 BAN_Ajoy:0 "Born in the small village of Mihijam in West Bengal, Ajoy Kumar Ghosh became accustomed with Indian Communism from an early age, moving with his father to the capital of Indian Communism, Kanpur. During his studies at Allahabad University he met and befriended Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt two legends of Indian Revolutionary Socialism. Initially a member of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association and then a member of the United Left Front, he quickly rose to the position of General Secretary of the United Left Front and led the Orissan Union Revolution in 1952. Now at war against the bourgeoisie elements of India, it is in his hands to lead the people of India towards a truly independent era free of restrictive castes and religious dogma."
