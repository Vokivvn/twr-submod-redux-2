 ## Leader Descriptions ##
 Georgy_Zhukov_desc:0 "Grand Marshal Georgy Zhukov was born on December 1st, 1896, to a peasant family in western Russia. He spent the early parts of his life rising through the ranks of the Imperial and then Red Armies, quickly becoming a leading Soviet Tactician by the late 1930s. During The Great Patriotic War, Zhukov would find himself tasked with the ultimately unsuccessful defense of Moscow, famously remarking; "I can hold the damn city! I could hold the entire damn nation if only I had the power!". After the fall of Moscow, Zhukov would again be tasked with the defense of Arkhangelsk, only to be forced out by A German Naval blockade. Zhukov quickly found himself out of favor with the Soviet Government, and in a dangerous position.\n\nWhen Lavrentiy Beria began his purges upon taking the Premiership, Zhukov joined those who fled to Siberia with Zhdanov and formed the Novosibirsk government. He, along with Nikolai Voznesensky and Nikita Khrushchev formed a Troika, ruling the state from behind the scenes. However, the Stalinist Orientation of Zhdanov's government continued to drive Zhukov away from the central government, and he once again took his supporters and fled to Krasnoyarsk, beyond the reach of Beria or Zhdanov. Now he bides his time, building his forces, waiting for the time to reclaim the Motherland and punish those who have harmed her."
 Rodion_Malinovsky_desc:0 "Supreme Marshal Rodion Malinovsky was born on November 23rd, 1898, to a broken family in western Ukraine. His father having died before his birth, his mother was forced to work odd jobs, and eventually moved to Southern Russia. She quickly remarried, however her husband refused to accept Rodion, eventually expelling him from the household at the age of 13. Malinovsky soon joined the Imperial army during the Great War, eventually fighting in France with the Russian Expeditionary Corps, and then the Foreign Legion after the Revolution began. He later would travel through Japanese-held Siberia to join the Red army, quickly rising through the Ranks until he was enlisted in the Frunze Military academy, despite haviong no formal education at all. He then later served as a General in Spain during the civil war, his absence from Russia during which helped him to escape Stalin's Military Purges.\n\nMalinovsky would find himself in command of sizable forces during the German-Soviet war, however he inevitably was forced to retreat like all soviet officers, into the areas east of the AA line. However, Malinovsky would be demoted by Beria soon after his ascension to power, leading to Malinovsky's infamous defection to Novosibirsk, during which he convinced every officer he met to join him. Malinovsky did not remain long however, as he quickly fled with Zhukov's forces after the Troika collapsed, quickly becoming the third highest ranked member of the Krasnoyarsk Red Army. His influence further solidified, when he developed a close friendship with the Marshal, due to their many hours spent together. However, yet again, Malinovsky would have to flee, this time even further east from Krasnoyarsk, as the deaths of Zhukov and Antonov, along with many civilian party members, had thrown the Capital into chaos. Malinovsky now leads the last shred of True Patriotism in the USSR, from which he will bring Zhukov's vision of a militaristic Union to fruition."

 KRA_A_Limping_Army_desc:0 "Following Grand Marshal Zhukov's departure from Novosibirsk, most of the Novosibirsk Red Army staff followed him into Krasnoyarsk.  However, this abundance of competent officers comes at the cost of most of the Army's manpower having remained with Zhdanov. This lack of Manpower must be addressed before the Grand Marshal can begin his Reclamation."

If we didn't have our most loyal friends in the army who are in the ranks of the Elite Guards Divisions, God only knows what would happen to us. Everyone needs such an army and discipline, and on these principles we will build a new army that will be able to resist all the troubles in front of it and regain what we lost a long time ago!

These men lacked commonality in many aspects, outside of their martial prowess, though they are unified by their great admiration for the pragmatic leadership of Zhukov. This pragmatism has made Zhukov far more accepting of elements that Beria desired dead, such as the newly formed "Committee" led by a leader from the Polish section of the Committee, and the Traditionalist Socialists of Vasily Zaitsev.

 twrkrasnoyarsk.1.t:0 "The State of the Government"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.1.d:0 "After the collapse of the Soviet Union under the leadership of Beria who tried to demote Grand Marshal's Georghy Zhukov and Konstantin Rokosovsky. Followed by a wave of supporters who rejected Beria's regime, a large number of people decided to follow in Zhukov's footsteps and finally arrived in Krasnoyarsk in 1950 where Zhukov formed Krasnoyarsk as militaristic state while Konev remained in Union, Rokosovsky and Zhdanov in Novosibirsk after ceasefire was achieved which created de facto areas of control which they hold now. In the cold heart of Siberia, Zhukov always considered the idea of returning to the old Union in all its glory, but there were factors in front of him that made that path more difficult. The Tuvan insurgents added a significant amount of damage to Zhukov's reconstitution of forces in order to start the process of the Union's complaint. Now the Union is facing a big problem of an internal nature that threatens it, and Zhukov has devised a plan to achieve that - through direct control. But will this Union last long enough to fulfill its aspirations?"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.1.a:0 "Only time will tell..."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.2.t:0 "Meeting With The Plurinational Committee"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.2.d:0 "Vyshinsky toured the corridors in which the Committee sat in its regular sessions, seeking some sort of entertainment. He looked out the windows occasionally and paid attention to the way the snow was falling. He paused for a moment, feeling as if he had seen something, but he wasn't quite sure what he was looking at. Whether he was drunk or not, it seemed to him that in the distance he could see a group of people breaking through the thick layers of snow, tirelessly moving towards their goal. But no one was there, Vyshinsky saw before him a hallucination that reminded him of the time when he came to Krasnoyarsk, moving with all his political comrades. A Pole by birth, he joined the Committee to later become their leader, leading all the people who hated Beria from the bottom of their souls anywhere, only that they no longer had to suffer his terror. The road led them through the harsh landscapes of Central Siberia, where they reached Novosibirsk hungry and sparsely supplied. But then he laughed through the pain, briefly letting air out of his mouth to realize that Novosibirsk was full of Stalinists who were just a milder shade of Beria. The fear of their repercussion was greater than their ability to survive the journey, they had to keep going, they had to do something to survive, and they continued their journey until almost dead they reached the borders of Krasnoyarsk, where Marshal Zhukov received them. Then he woke up from his daydream, he realized that he could not see anything and that it was just one of the illusions he had, the trauma he was going through. He was feeling cold, he had to go somewhere to warm up. He remembered in which direction he was going, a meeting with Zhukov's people was to be held because he decided to accept his ideas and members as full-fledged actors of the political scene. Now he could at least partially amuse himself with what his goal was, to save Russia from the onslaught of evil."
 twrkrasnoyarsk.2.a:0 "Getting in tune for meeting, straight and narrow..."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.3.t:0 "Traditionalist Socialists"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.3.d:0 "After shaking hands with Zhukov, Zaytsev left the office after a successful meeting aimed at signing co-operation between the two sides. He went out with his friend while they were talking about how this agreement would bring significant benefits to Krasnoyarsk and Russia so that the topic of conversation would move to the other side.\n\n"It's been a long time since we agreed on something, hasn't it?" Zaytsev spoke as his friend nodded.\n\n"When did they come, uh, it was two years ago?"\n\n"Yes. fuck, like yesterday was when I remembered that... almost like time flew by in this icy desert..."\n\n"I agree with you. It is just a little weird for me, remembering all that, you know?"\n\n"How did Zhdanov kick us out?"\n\n"Exactly. I dream of those cold nights when we were dying of cold and hunger just to get somewhere, where we can be our own, where we can calm down and create something that will last?"\n\n"May I tell you my honest opinion about That?"\n\n"Sure."\n\n"I think we just found it. I think it's already here and we just need to accept this and keep doing it."\n\n"Maybe you're right, my friend, maybe you're right...""
 twrkrasnoyarsk.3.a:0 "I've gone down to the crossroads, fell on my knees to find a better future."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.4.t:0 "Knife of the Betrayals"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.4.d:0 "Marshal Zhukov sat alone in his office, leaning over the table, wondering what he had to do next because he was left without allies day by day, slowly losing their support. A memory rushed through his head that could not leave him, refusing to believe that he had extended a hand of friendship to the Tuvans to build a new future together, only to eventually turn against him as if they were the blood enemy they needed. cut off the neck as relentlessly as possible. He put down his notebook, looking out the window as he heard new shots open, just a few miles from his residence.\n\n"When will this end more?"\n\nZhukov said quietly and desperately, looking at new lives to be lost in senseless struggles with each other instead of turning all resources towards rebuilding the state and seizing Beria... this is how it should happen...\n\n"It seems that I will never see the unification of Russia. Never again.""
 twrkrasnoyarsk.4.a:0 "Hide the pain Marshal, hide the pain."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.5.t:0 "Question of the NKVD"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.5.d:0 "The NKVD in Krasnoyarsk is in a weird state of limbo, with their counterparts in Perm being corrupted.\n\nThe NKVD must reform, and these reforms must be made to serve our regime."
 twrkrasnoyarsk.5.a:0 "NKVD answer to the established Soviets."
 twrkrasnoyarsk.5.b:0 "A new court system."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.6.t:0 "A Beleaguered Envoy"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.6.d:0 "The vehicle stopped in front of Zhukov's residence. There was a Tuvan in it who arrived by order from the Tuvan command headquarters to finally start negotiations on a truce between the Red Army in Krasnoyarsk and the Tuvan revolt, which suffered more and more defeats as time went on. Dressed formally, he stepped across the entrance to the residence to be immediately greeted in the hallway by Marshal Zhukov. Reaching out to greet him warmly, they headed for his office.\n\n"Marshal, I'm glad to see you as much as you think of me."\n\n"The only thing I'm glad about in this situation is that you've finally agreed to negotiations." Zhukov said briefly and with a pause, to the Tuvan, the delegate agreed with him.\n\n"You're right, Marshal. I'd just like to talk about it if you don't mind."\n\n"That's no problem. Feel free to say what you want." Six hours passed in this conversation, in which Zhukov's proposal to start negotiations that would end the Tuvan revolt was finally accepted."
 twrkrasnoyarsk.6.a:0 "Peace was always an option."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.7.t:0 "Tuvans Agree to Peace"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.7.d:0 "In one of the largest halls in the capital Krasnoyarsk, Tuvan rebels gathered who led the revolt all this time with Zhukov's people. The meeting passed without any incidents on both sides and what was required to be fulfilled to achieve final peace did not pose any problem for Zhukov. Agreeing to Tuvan's conditions to provide amnesty and unhindered residence to all troops, as well as membership in the ICPS as a Tuvan section, Zhukov and the rebels finally put their signatures on paper and thus ended this bloody fairy tale that took many lives for nothing..."
 twrkrasnoyarsk.7.a:0 "Piece of mind, piece of the body for eternal peace..."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.8.t:0 "Zhukov's Last Betrayal"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.8.d:0 "The streets were on fire after the Tuvan army invaded the capital Krasnoyarsk, while blood was shed due to a huge battle that engulfed the entire city. It seemed as if everything was collapsing, he could not turn around because he knew that a knife was waiting for him on both sides, leaving a deep cut, falling into the snow that swallows him as he looks at the sky, thinking; "Where did I go wrong?"\nAn explosion erupted in the center of the capital when a group of Tuvans planted a bomb under Red Army trucks, taking the lives of dozens of soldiers who will never see the Sun of New Hope or the snow of darkness in Krasnoyarsk. The first front line was breached and the Tuvans launched an offensive by crossing barricades that were quickly erected to repel their attacks. Nothing else could stop them. The Red Army was retreating towards the center of the capital, but it had long since been destroyed. Chaos ensued shortly after the explosion. The Red Army could no longer understand which side the Tuvans were coming from, which made things much easier for the rebels when the battle took place in the center, not far from Zhukov's residence.\nThe door of the residence was pierced by a grenade that collapsed one part of the wall and disfigured the entire corridor, which was supposed to be part of the agreement when the revolt ended. But luck wanted to talk differently in that hallway. The flood of the Tuvans filled the residence while Zhukov fought bravely with them, but any resistance here was in vain. One bullet would kill one Tuvan, but is it worth it when they have no mercy and throw three new people into the battle for each killed? Not wanting to flee the battle, Zhukov fell as a prisoner of the Tuvan rebels, but he fought bravely not to survive the collapse of Krasnoyarsk, like Constantine XI Palaeologus in 1453, when his life fell before Constantinople.\nZhukov was brought in front of the square, while the Tuvans improvised around the noose they found quite by accident, looking for the perfect method to kill him. Putting him next to a tree, beaten and tortured when they dragged him, Zhukov tried to say something, but he did not succeed. He just felt someone put a rope around his neck as he heard a branch crackle as a noose was set on it. It was all over. "I let you down..." Zhukov said quietly before the rope would let his body hang..."
 twrkrasnoyarsk.8.a:0 "The bitter taste of blood on the mouth, breathless in the lungs, falling like a hero in the name of all heroes..."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.9.t:0 "Rokossovsky in Hiding"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.9.d:0 "He was all alone, feeling the cold of Siberia creep under his skin as he desperately tried to hide from the people who were looking for him, who demanded to see him alive or dead, as befits Zhukov's regime. For several days in a row, he was on the move, without any rest unless he stopped to drink some water and then proceeded with light but sure steps in the direction of anything he might call salvation. He was hungry, and thirsty after a long journey, he had no one to help him on his journey but only a steely will to survive in whatever way he could. And the ways were slowly disappearing, he felt the hopelessness of the situation press him more and more and suffocate him until he knelt before his pursuers, feeling their hand on his neck throwing him behind steel bars in chains. He dreamed of the freedom he could not have, he only had this current situation in which he found himself, and he did not see a possible way out of it. Rising somewhere in the middle of the night, twitching from the nightmare in which he saw the firing squad standing in front of him, Rokossovsky felt the cold sweat on his face pour over him. He looked around. He saw only the darkness that swallowed him, the road in front of him, And something that he kept repeating in himself..."
 twrkrasnoyarsk.9.a:0 "Just to survive this night..."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.10.t:0 "Hit the Road"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.10.d:0 "The chase broke out after the patrol noticed that Rokossovsky was fighting to escape despite his visible fatigue, so they had to resort to more drastic measures, even though it was issued by the authorities to catch him alive. They opened fire in his direction, but all the bullets managed to miss their target, and Rokossovsky now had to give his last atoms of strength to escape his pursuers. "This is just another normal day. You have already experienced this." Rokossovsky told himself that he could confirm to himself that he would be able to survive just one more night without being caught. It seemed as if the voices were getting farther and farther away, and he couldn't even hear the shots anymore. Did he run so fast that he got rid of everything that had happened so far and didn't even notice when they disappeared? It is safest to say that it was so. Rokossovsky finally managed to breathe a sigh of relief, he hadn't run this long since the war broke out between Krasnoyarsk and Novosibirsk, but nothing else mattered. He knew now that he was safe, that no one would be able to do anything to him.\n\n"At least I can rest later..." He said to himself, before continuing his journey..."
 twrkrasnoyarsk.10.a:0 "So close, no matter how far..."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.11.t:0 "Condemning Zhdanov"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.11.d:0 ""It is finally time for that drunken bastard to say goodbye to his toxic ideas that threatened to destroy our political scene, to poison any future that a new and reformed Russia can bring!"\n\n"We succeeded in our goal, which was set a long time ago, and that is to remove this man from the list of living people! We will continue with our policy, we will not allow any revisionists to pollute the environment in which we find ourselves! And anyone who finds himself on the list of people who fit Zhdanov's way of governing the state will be eliminated from the political system of our state!""
 twrkrasnoyarsk.11.a:0 "Because only sober Russia is a strong Russia!"

 twrkrasnoyarsk.12.t:0 "Adapting Zhdanov's Legacy"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.12.d:0 ""Maybe alcohol ruined his brain, but I honestly think we can do a couple of tweaks here and there, change the sentences to something more meaningful because it's obvious that this was written with a drunken hand and we can say this is the work of our hands." Those were the words of one of the ministers to Zhukov who was sitting at his desk in the office.\n\n"Do you think, Minister, that this is a smart idea?"\n\n"Because if we can combine the good sides of his idea with the good sides of our government, we will be able to redouble our efforts."\n\n"I'm not sure if that will work." Zhukov began to think, this was a good point. As much as Zhdanov's drunken brain could come up with toxic ideas that were as toxic as alcohol, Zhukov had to accept this proposal because it seemed like the only way to bring the situation under control.\n\n"Do it."\n\n"I understand, Marshal." The minister said, before leaving the office."
 twrkrasnoyarsk.12.a:0 "Not so sweet surrender to these drunkard's ideas."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.13.t:0 "The Marshal's Speech"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.13.d:0 ""... and then we will march victoriously to Moscow, with raised flags and bayonets that will carry Beria's head after all the disgusting deeds he committed, and we will not stop there either! Moscow will be only the first phase in our victorious steps! Norilsk was only a small obstacle that imposed itself and did not want to agree peacefully for the sake of a greater goal - the salvation of Mother Russia! I am speaking to you as the Marshal of the Red Army and as the leader of the state, this will only be the beginning of our campaign! Today it is Norlisk, tomorrow it will be Moscow, and the day after tomorrow the whole of Germany will tremble before the song of the Red Army!"\n\nThe Marshal was in the climax of his speech when the people greeted him with loud applause and shouts letting them know that they would be with him, to the very end. Waving to the gathered people, Zhukov returned to his office while the applause continued. He knew one thing. Everything he has said so far was true and he will not stop until he fulfills everything he promised himself and the people today."
 twrkrasnoyarsk.13.a:0 "I want to see Hitler's grave burned down!"

 twrkrasnoyarsk.14.t:0 "Kosygin's Speech"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.14.d:0 ""I am telling you this as if I were one of you, knowing what an ordinary person thinks when he hears the word liberation of the Russian people. We have gone through many different periods in which we have seen our nation fragmented into a relentless number of pieces scattered across the Siberian wasteland, leaving what had charms to German paws. We have been given a chance, people, now we are able to do everything that was necessary in order to restore the lost glory, lost honor, and respect. Norilsk is just one of the stopovers in this desolate wasteland that will serve us so that we can kickstart the war machines and embark on a campaign that will end this hopelessness in which we find ourselves."\n\nKosygin ended his speech, coldly but again, convincingly as if he could always speak in such a way that people listened to him attentively and remained faithful to his speech, no matter how long and short, loud or quiet. He greeted the people by waving both hands, continuing towards his office.\n\n"And now, the race with Zhukov can begin." He said quietly to himself before closing the balcony window on which he had stood a few moments ago."
 twrkrasnoyarsk.14.a:0 "He said that he would be back soon..."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.15.t:0 "Handling the State"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.15.d:0 "The future of the government is now in a position to be decided by us, and two major factions have emerged. The first is that of Kosygin, supporting a more loose policy on anti-Soviet positions. With the period of warlordism, Alexei Nikolayevich has argued, many alternatives to the true form of communism have emerged, and to try to put them all down would be a fruitless endeavour. The other faction, however, argues that these revisionists are nearly as dangerous as reactionaries, and must be equally dealt with. Who shall we side with?"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.15.a:0 "Down with revisionism!"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.15.b:0 "Let's go with Alexei Nikolayevich's idea."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.16.t:0 "Handling the Industrial Base"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.16.d:0 "The matter of industry has been a pressing one for every communist government, and ours' is no different. In regards to the matter, two main proposals have come up; the first is that of Aleksei Antonov, who proposes to keep things similar to Stalinist planning and rebuild industry in a similar way to its pre-war status. On the other hand, Kosygin has proposed a more technocratic reconstruction plan, focusing on high-tech and light industry. Which shall we choose?"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.16.a:0 "Antonov has the right idea."
 twrkrasnoyarsk.16.b:0 "Kosygin's new ways have some merit."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.17.t:0 "Handling the Disparate Factions"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.17.d:0 "There are two primary factions which make up the party in Krasnoyarsk; the Sniper Clique, headed by Vasily Zaytsev, is a more pragmatist force which seeks to work alongside conservative social forces such as the Orthodox Church. On the other hand, there is the Plurinational Committee. Consisting of several minority ethnic groups, the Plurinational Committee advocates for decentralisation of the Soviet Union and support for further rights of minorities. Some have suggested that we crack down on factionalism, while others have claimed this division is just party democracy at work. How should we deal with this problem?"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.17.a:0 "Enforce Zhukov's ideas."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.222.d:0 "News has come out from the city of Krasnoyarsk, as it appears that the Russian nation has been reunited. The new leader of the newly-declared Soviet Union is none other than Georgy Zhukov, leader of the Red Army in the Soviet-German War. Zhukov announced via radio address today that the last remnants of resistance had been obliterated.\n\nAs Premier, Zhukov has supported a hawkish foreign policy, particularly in regards to what is officially termed the "Temporarily-Occupied Territories" of Eastern Europe. The General Secretary of the Communist Party, Sabit Orudzhev, has sought to reconcile relations between the various ethnic groups, as well as strengthening the power of the SSRs. The world now looks to see a fledgling Russia's first moves..."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.22.d:0 "With our state now in a good, stable position, some disagreements have arisen from within the government as we are faced with a decision long put off for then relative unimportance. A Soviet state must be established off of one out of two possible foundations: one is to develop it based on Marxist theory for the ideal sicialist state, which the more ideologically firm of us favor; or it can be developed off of the national idea of a Russian state, with the very history of Russia itself serving as the state's foundation, favored by the more pragmatic and patriotic of us. No matter which we choose, of course, the basis of the justification of our state's existence will have elements of the other, but every government will naturally have its own favorites, and we are no exception to this rule."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.23.d:0 "Outwardly, the party is fully unified under its new leader Zhukov. In truth, Zhukov's influence is far from absolute, and other figures in the party have their own power blocs and agendas. Among them, Ivan Serov has become one of the strongest, holding significant influence in the autonomous intelligence and security agencies of the Krasnoyarsk government. Zhukov being an army man, this side of the state does not lie fully within his reach, and a potential rival has instead stood as a possible threat.\n\nIn the name of unity therefore, and to make sure the party and state is strong in the face of foreign threats such as rival governments and, ultimately, the great German enemy, Zhukov is determined to bring Serov on side. Serov is clearly too strong to just bully into submission, but Zhukov is confident that with a little private discussion, a compromise can be found between them. Behind the closed doors of the meeting room, there is back and forth but ultimately an agreement is found. What this agreement entails will remain quiet, even to the upper echelons of the party. However, with a successful conclusion, all are simply glad that the party and state is now significantly more unified, and none are more glad than Zhukov himself."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.25.t:0 "Matters of Economics"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.25.d:0 "As the restructuring of our young state is further discussed, the question of how our economic policy should proceed is being debated within our government. While all are united in our commitment to socialism, there is significant disagreement on what exactly is the best method to bring it about.\n\nOrthodox Marxists argue in favour of our Bolshevik roots. Citing the primacy of industrial development in Marxist economic theory, they favour a focus on industrialisation, the interests of our traditional backers, the urban working class, and the development of our industrial and urban centres. They argue for a continuation of Lenin and Stalin's approach to rapid industrialisation and the finishing of their incomplete project.\n\nOn the other hand, others call for a change in strategy. Citing the catastrophes that beset the USSR in the decades since its creation, they call for more agrarian-focused economic strategy. To the agrarian socialists, the peasant is the real backbone of the Russian economy, and agriculture must be reformed and modernised first before an advanced economy can be built on top of it.\n\nWhichever strategy is chosen, the party must come to a consensus, and be united behind its decision."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.26.t:0 "Autarky in Russia?"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.26.d:0 "In the debate over our economic strategies, few details are as controversial within the party as our economic relations with the outside world.\n\nHaving grown disillusioned with the world beyond that has fallen to such depths of depravity, some are calling for a policy of Autarky going forwards. Russia is, after all, a vast land rich in all kinds of resources - we have no need for the goods and products of foreign lands, and avoiding any level of reliance on the fascist or capitalist nations will ensure that we can never again be caught off guard as we were when the capitalists made peace with Germany and let them face us alone.\n\nOthers insist that the benefits of trade are too great to give up. Our incomplete industrial buildup under Stalin was facilitated in large part through trade and expertise sharing with the west, and economic growth is much easier to achieve when there is freer access to foreign markets for imports and exports, and access to foreign expertise and investment in our own economy. The basis of any future socialist Russia, therefore, cannot be built on autarky, but must be integrated with the global economy, to strengthen our state and improve the lives of our people.\n\nNeither side of this heated ideological debate is likely to be convinced, but if the party and nation is to remain united, one side must win."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.27.d:0 "Ever since he got his position, Kosygin was not that liked inside the party. His attempts at reforms and antagonism against the authoritarian wing of the party has been a cause of great criticism from those who would decry him as either a "wolf in sheep's clothing", a reactionary spy sent to undermine the restoration of the true Soviet Union, or a sheer incompetent fool who can't be trusted to run a country. And his recent spree of unsuccessful reforms have lately seemed to legitimise those concerns for more and more party members, with the tension coming to a head at the latest party meeting. The atmosphere couldn't be any rougher for the man, as various displeased party members kept rambling on about his failures, shutting him up promptly whenever he tried to explain himself. One comrade's words in particular stuck out to him. "Keep this up Alexei, and your work here is done." He was right, if he can't find a way to please the party his efforts at reforming the system will all be for nothing."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.28.d:0 "Today in Kemerovo, Marshal Zhukov attended the opening of a prosperous new development. Comrades from the Ministry of Production have opened a new factory focusing on the manufacturing of civil transport vehicles. "Today our great nation continues forth in its march of progress into a new era. Over the past year, laborers have worked hard to open this new manufactury which in the coming years will no doubt help our wonderful socialist society prosper." Minister Andrei Kubinkov, a minister from the MoP, spoke at the opening ceremony.\n\nThe ceremony concluded with Marshal Zhukov being given a large pair of scissors and cutting a red velvet ribbon, signifying the start of the first workday. The first shift of workers walked through the gates of the complex and immediately began their shift. After the festivities, around 12 hours after its opening, the plant churned out its first bus, a Model 51 vehicle capable of transporting 60 people."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.29.d:0 "Today at noon in the industrial complex of Sverdlovsk the workers were all given leave to attend the grand opening of The Komsomol Agricultural Machine Plant, also known as the KZSM. The massive, almost 120,000 square meter factory space was designed in the early years of the Zhukovite government and after many months of hard work and resource gathering, is ready to open for production.\n\nThe local Komsomol members attended the opening and their leader, Nikolai Belinski gave a speech:\n"My comrades and I are proud to have not only had this complex named after our wonderful organization but also to have participated in the construction. Indeed all members of the chapter assisted in the child-friendly portions of construction. We were taught by knowledgable comrades in the designing of the facilities, the manner in which the cement was laid, and the minutia of everyday work. We are proud to have helped further our wonderful country and our wonderful belief."\n\nPremier Zhukov was busy during the time of the opening with affairs of state and sent the First Secretary, who was given the honors of cutting the ceremonial red velvet. Once cut, the first shift of workers stormed into the building to begin their work day."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.30.d:0 "All are agreed on the importance of rebuilding our armed forces to defend ourselves from reactionary powers and retake our place in the world, but there is debate on how exactly to strengthen our army.\n\nSome emphasise quantity - calling for broad and mass conscription, they argue that battles are won through overwhelming force, and a large army is necessary to provide the strength in numbers to overwhelm the enemy and prevail.\n\nOn the other side, there are those that see quality as more important. Wanting tighter conscription, they argue that an army is only as good as the men in it, and discipline, professionalism and skill in combat are most crucial. They promote focusing on improved training of elite forces, using both domestic and foreign experience.\n\nHow should our military reconstruction program proceed?"

 twrkrasnoyarsk.31.t:0 "The Status of Women"
 twrkrasnoyarsk.31.d:0 "Another area of debate relating to the armed forces is over the role of women within them. While women served important roles throughout the military during the Great Patriotic War, the extent to which they should continue to do so has come under scrutiny.\n\nProponents argue that women's roles should be expanded and more women brought into the military, perhaps even through conscription, to boost the number of personnel available. Certainly, it would help alleviate the shortages of manpower following the devastating losses in the last war. This is controversial among many though, who see women's roles on the domestic front as being of greater importance, and want to see women's frontline roles either remain as they are or be further restricted."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.32.d:0 "A worrying pattern has emerged from our military posts on and near the eastern frontier. While skirmishes and attacks have not been uncommon, in recent days these attacks have intensified. Multiple bases and command posts and formations on routine patrols have come under attacks ranging from surprise gun ambushes to improvised explosive attacks. Most of the perpetrators have escaped back into the forests, but those captured and interrogated have had left wing allegiances, as expected.\n\nWhile we do not yet know what is causing this intensification of frontier skirmishes, our eastern forces have been put on higher alert and what little reinforces we can reasonably muster have been sent to assist."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.33.d:0 "Following military victory, the Far East has been reclaimed from the reactionaries, the foreign-backed 'Republic' overthrown and the region brought back under Soviet control. For now, it remains under military occupation and authority, but its government and society must be reintegrated into the broader state.\n\nFrom their base in Vladivostok, the reactionaries unfortunately managed to stamp out much of the leftist movement in the Far East, purging Communist Party members and others who resisted their rule. As a result, we have our work cut out in rebuilding a socialist presence. Just as in the days of the civil war, we must make sure to spread our socialist ideals, recruit new members into the Party and rebuild a powerful leftist movement in the Far East."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.34.d:0 "For several months, our prisons held thousands of republican officials, following the capture of Vladivostok and the collapse of the Republic's army. We have decided to finally initiate trials against these fascist prisoners. In a quick sweep, the court declared a big majority of them guilty, and sentenced them to death. Shortly afterwards, firing lines would be set in most prisons, mass graves would be dug for the corpses, and soldiers would begin practice for their task.\n\nIt would be simple, the riflemen would shoot the sentenced, while a commissar would give the "coup de grace" with his pistol, to make sure no one is left alive. And so it started: generals, officers, bureaucrats, mayors, governors, and all kinds of republican government officials were disposed of in a quick, systematic manner. The executions took almost a week; many prisons went from bursting with prisoners to being almost totally empty. The mass graves were full by the last executions, they were rapidly covered."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.35.d:0 "With the fall of the Russian Republic to the newly resurgent Soviet Union, many anti-Soviet or affluent Russians have been steadily fleeing to the US-controlled island of Sakhalin for refuge from the red menace. This wave of refugees arose when the fall of Vladivostok became imminent, with over one hundred thousand rushing to take ferries to Sakhalin before the Soviets cut off maritime transport. Following the city's fall, this tide of refugees leveled off as fewer and fewer could gain access to boats on the cold Siberian coast. It appears that the refugees are heading for the United States primarily out of fears of deportation by the Chinese and Korean authorities due to a combination of natural hostility and Soviet pressure. As the United States is a global superpower across the Pacific Ocean with an overseas territory close to their residence, the choice was relatively straightforward. Currently, we have begun delegating resources to better manage the influx of refugees, with them being temporarily housed on the island until they can be processed and resettled on the West Coast."

Almost immediately after the creation of this headquarters, orders for branches to be established were sent all along the western frontier. As is speculated in many corners, this move is in truth preparation for the increasingly likely scenario of another conflict with Germany, to once and for all put an end to their menace to Russia and Russians. In this coming bloodshed, a well coordinated and better supplied partisan movement sabotaging the enemy at every turn will be nothing short of vital to the war effort."

To attempt to avert the danger of this threat, at least in the context of its use on us, the Committee on Nuclear Warfare has been established in order to discuss all matters related to their namesake and then advise us on the proper course of action to reduce and prevent the danger so far as is possible without endangering the national interest, which includes advice on development of our own nuclear programme for purposes of deterrence. This committee will be made up of nuclear experts and air force professionals selected as impartially as we can ensure, so that the future of the Soviet peoples will be kept safe from this very modern threat."

Following a series of insurgent attacks on garrisons and colonists in southern Belarus, a seemingly spontaneous wave of uprisings swept across the region, with many thousands of forced labourers on farms and mines briefly joining forces with the insurgents and seizing swathes of territory.\n\nWithin days, order was restored by a rapid response by local commanders and a harsh crackdown on rebelling native workers. Sporadic gunfights continue, and some workers have escaped to join the partisans, but on the whole the uprising has been successfully contained and crushed. While bouts of disorder are common, the scale of this latest revolt has caused concern, and many believe it could be a sign of bigger things to come."

While it is alarming that their nuclear technology is even more advanced than previously thought, our military experts have assured us that by the time they can put such advancements into practice, we will have deterrence in the form of nuclear weapons of our own. These designs, along with the nuclear resources captured with them, will be immensely useful for the advancement of our own nuclear programme and the development of our own nuclear bomb. This is a huge step forward not only for Soviet science and Soviet national security, but all the Soviet people as a whole."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.40.d:0 "For a nation ruled by those who proclaim themselves to be 'socialist,' the German Reich has something of a bad habit of imprisoning, torturing, and executing others who legitimately fall under such a description, much less the true red sons and daughters of communism. Still, those few Germans who both legitimately subscribe to our ideology and have managed to avoid the Gestapo's grasp know that there is only one place on Earth where they are both truly safe, and may even have the chance to change their nation's fate. By scrounging up however many German-born Marxist-Leninists we can, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics can now officially declare the formation of a German Government-in-Exile, the stated purpose of which shall be to slay the Fascist beast, restore legitimate rule to the fatherland, and further the global revolution. The dream of the hammer and sickle appearing on the official flag of a German nation, replacing the Swastika for all to see is a long way away, but if and when it does finally occur, it shall be through these exiles that such a victory is achieved. Of course, it is clear to all, even among members of this 'Soviet for the Liberation of the German Republic,' that if its stated goals are actually achieved, the resulting state that will be created from such a government will be little more than a puppet under our control..."

Today, on orders from what was formerly the Krasnoyarsk government under Rodion Malinovsky, the capital has been moved once more to Novosibirsk, both to unite the government with this symbol of Russian independence, as well as to improve the administration by reestablishing the capital in a city more significant for the governing apparatus.

This impressive feat was only accomplished with great struggle against enemies on all fronts, but now the Russian people celebrate an end to their short but bloody era of strife and division. Though the opinion of international experts on Malinovsky is sharply divided, with some criticizing his aims and ambitions and others hailing him as a return to relative moderation for the Soviet communists, there is no denying that today many Russians are breathing a collective sigh of relief."

 twrkrasnoyarsk.44.d:0 "With our nation secure, our rule unquestioned, and our lands restored, there is no doubt that we are the official government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Therefore it is perhaps only natural that the Security Council of the United Nations has offered an invitation to us to join their global alliance, at last extending to us their recognition and limited support. While membership among the UN would serve to further legitimize our rule, as well as deepen ties with the western powers, the question becomes whether or not we wish to deepen those ties at all: After all, the global revolution is an inevitability, and working within an organization so thoroughly dominated by capitalist powers could prove harmful to us from an ideological perspective. Furthermore, many of our citizens still feel an intense hatred towards the United States as well as the United Kingdom, their blindness to our suffering at the hands of the teutons having not been so easily forgotten. That being said, a compromise has been proposed by some of our more politically savvy ministers: We can accept their offer, on the condition that we are elevated to the same status as the four members of the Security Council, thus ensuring that our interests are both protected, and perhaps even spread, across the globe. Thus, the age-old question must be answered: Do we subscribe to realpolitik, or do we remain true to our cause?"

 twrkrasnoyarsk.46.d:0 "As the USSR was beaten back in the German-Soviet War, all of their diplomatic missions were recalled when it appeared their ability to return home was narrowing, leaving the nation unable to formally communicate with the outside world for decades. However, with the USSR reclaiming its territory from the various splinter states that had cropped up in the power vacuum of its collapse, so too is its desire to reestablish its international presence, with our nation being their latest focus.\n\nRecently, the Russians have sent a diplomatic delegation to [Root.Capital.GetName] with the expressed intention of initiating diplomatic ties between our two nations as shared socialist republics. The delegation also came with Soviet military equipment for distribution among our armed forces, with the expressed intention for it to be used to defend ourselves against the numerous capitalist regimes that seek to bring our destruction. Given the unique standing our two nations find ourselves in, each as the vanguard of the workers across two continents, we have naturally reciprocated the Russian's desire to establish an embassy within our country for the advancement of mutual relations between us."

The upper echelons of the Party are very much divided between different cliques and factions with their own ideological positions and policy goals.\n\nThe multi-ethnic Plurinational Committee, led by Mao Anying, unsurprisingly supports a variety of policies designed to promote the interests of the many different ethnic groups under the Krasnoyarsk government. Language protection, quotas for party officials from different ethnic groups and possible political decentralisation are their goals.\n\nBy contrast, the Sniper Clique, led by Vasiliy Zaytsev, supports state and societal unity. Supporting what their opponents derisively call 'Great Russian Chauvinism', the Sniper Clique wants a continuation and strengthening of the privileged place of Russian within the Soviet bureaucracy and opposes what they see as 'nationalist' promotion of ethnic minority privileges.

The very image of Nazi military might and political dominance was demolished today on the orders of our Soviet overlords, citing security concerns, the fact that the building itself is structurally unsound, and that it will be an important step in the denazification process. This is but another in a long series of other demolitions and destructions meant to remove every last trace of National Socialist architecture in our country, though none have been as dramatic as this: An official speech by the Chairman was held to commemorate its destruction, one even western media was invited to attend and record, as, by his word, the halls in which Hitler and his gang of tyrants and murderers was annihilated before their eyes and cameras, to jubilant cheers from all."

With our capital liberated and the Union restored, the decision was made to continue construction on the long-delayed megaproject, and after a surprisingly fast period of construction, the building is complete.\n\nThe Supreme Soviet will soon begin holding sessions within its colossal 100-metre tall grand hall, as Lenin watches over his battered but restored city and Union."

Construction on the original in Moscow was postponed by the Nazi invasion and occupation. With the restored Soviet Union's victory over Germany, the decision was made to build a stripped down version in occupied Berlin to house the new government when it is built.\n\nIt is hoped that the towering scale of this structure, matching the old Volkshalle in size, will remind the German people of who is now in charge of their country."

As the Red Army has, despite all odds, turned the tables on their former oppressors and seized control of Germany, a Red Terror has gripped the nation.\n\nDetermined to bring justice to those who supported the Nazi regime's reign of terror over eastern Europe, occupational forces have launched massive reprisals across occupied Germany. In their eagerness to destroy every trace of Nazism, however, Soviet occupation authorities are casting the widest possible net. Millions have been killed, brutalised, arrested or otherwise harassed based on any evidence of connection to the Nazi party or regime, however tenuous, or no evidence at all, as those denounced as Nazi sympathisers by their neighbours are often carted away without question. Rumours of mass reprisals committed against civilians by Soviet forces are common, as Moscow, just as filled with resentment and hatred against the German nation as its people, either turns a blind eye or tacitly supports these harsh measures.\n\nWhile the official policy of the Soviet government is otherwise, it seems as though the mantra of "an eye for an eye" is popular among the forces occupying Germany."

Originally formed as a unit to fight from behind enemy lines for the Reich in tandem with legitimate front line Wehrmacht units, the focus for such an organization shifted dramatically following our occupation, becoming the primary guerilla force fighting for the old National Socialist regime. Comprised of Heer and SS veterans alike, these last remnants of the Nazi empire are organized and growing, commanding and directing several smaller cells throughout Germany, and are believed to be the masterminds behind the assassination of Field Marshell Zhukov. Regardless if their influence truly extended that far or not, they have been a thorn in our side for far too long. Tonight, that all ends.\n\nThe Berlin Cell of the Werwolves was stamped out at a battle before dawn yesterday evening, with many guerillas choosing to fight to the death, but many others choosing instead to surrender, in hopes of mercy. None was granted, of course, as this afternoon, an impromptu public execution was scheduled for these radicals-far from an uncommon sight in the new Germany-as each and every survivor was hanged, one by one. With the crushing of this cell, the head of the Werwolf snake has been decapitated, significantly reducing their ability to operate, and by extension, the ability of all other resistance groups to operate as well."

Apparently sick of our administration's "gross and repeated failures," Moscow has decided to dispatch further soldiers across our nation, increasing the size of the Soviet Occupational Army to perhaps an excessive degree, without so much as consulting us beforehand.\n\nWhile we certainly cannot deny that the aid is appreciated, and perhaps even necessary, the true communists of Germany are already chafing under the occupation, easily seeing through our claims of being more than a mere puppet government.

Even worse are rumors that some of these Soviets are not even motivated by a desire to wipe out the menace that invaded the birthplace of Lenin, but by pure sadism or greed, intentionally putting to death innocent civilians out of revenge, to sate their bloodlust, or to loot what little they own.\n\nThese bands, being so brazen and repentless in their acts, should be put to death themselves under both military and civilian law, and yet, our overlords continue to protect such men even now, handing down token punishments that hardly match the severity of the crime. Our people are even starting to whisper that these murders are not the random acts of violence they seem to be, but were in fact ordered by at least these soldiers' superior officers, and at most, as some of the more paranoid rumors claim, the General Secretary himself! While we can be most certain that these accusations are baseless, the fact remains that any uniformed Russian is essentially free to commit murder as they please, and recieve only minimal punishment so long as they proclaim it to be in the name of ending National Socialism."

The trials were held in Berlin and were widely publicized around the world, showcasing every detail of how the Werwolfs orchestrated the assassination to leave no doubt to their guilt, with the judges finding the suspects guilty in nearly every case presented to them, sentencing them to death via hanging. In total, 137 individuals who assisted in the assassination have been executed.\n\nPeople's Commissar of Internal Affairs Ivan Seov has announced a formal conclusion to the investigation into the assassination, given that a complete picture of the event has been obtained. However, numerous connections to other Werwolf cells have been identified and will be investigated in their own capacity. Speaking in a radio address on the assassination, Premier [GetLeader] expressed gratitude towards the NKVD for their swift and thorough deliverance of justice against the perpetrators of the vile crime and warned any other Werwolfs that they would face the same fate should they not give up their senseless struggle and return to civilian life immediately."

After roughly two days of futile attempts to rally support from the party against the so-called "opportunists" seeking to remove him to increase their political capital, Serov quickly learned that any support or sympathy anyone had for him had vanished overnight. Left with no other options, he then proceeded to flee [Root.Capital.GetName] into the countryside to avoid arrest. With the Presidium stripping Serov of all his honors and positions in a special session the next day, thus removing the final barrier protecting him from arrest, a large-scale manhunt was initiated across the nation to arrest the man on the charges of treason and terrorism.\n\nThis did not take long, for Serov was discovered in an abandoned farm outside [Root.Capital.GetName], albeit not in the desired condition, as he had committed suicide by gunshot hours prior. Left behind was his last will and testament/suicide note in which he proclaims his innocence against the charges pressed against him, reiterating them being a plot against him from his enemies within the party, concluding with his resolution to kill himself in an act of defiance to refuse them the satisfaction of killing him themselves. While some more conspiratorially minded members of the public take this as proof of an even larger conspiracy within the government, it's most likely the truth of the matter is that Serov simply did not want to go through the humiliation of being put on trial, and knowing that his life would soon be coming to an end anyway, decided to take the shortest way out.\n\nWith Serov dead, the nation now turns inwards to continue mourning the death of its hero, and though recent revelations have provided some closure to the public, it is still no replacement for the man who turned our greatest humiliation into our greatest triumph.

Through careful maneuvering through words, political influence, and having the right men in the right place, the center of power within the Soviet Union once more rests within that of the First Secretary. This is not to say that the entire government revolves around Kosygin in the same way that Stalin had, but rather that Kosygin has the most agency and voice within the government compared to others. If tragedy strikes and the First Secretary cannot execute his authority, then state and party institutions will be strong enough to survive such a departure. Additionally, this is not to say Marshal Zhukov is entirely sidelined within the government, as he still maintains a key presence as the Premier and in military affairs, although such influence is far from the total control he exercised only a few years ago. The Marshal also still holds immediate recognition among our citizens as the leader of the Soviet Union, although this seems to not be under threat from Kosygin, who seems content to simply hold power behind the scenes for the well-being of the state rather than create a major public persona."

Under this version of the Soviet system, the Marshal served as the government's Premier while Alexei Kosygin served as the First Secretary of the party to retain civilian representation against the military establishment within the Council of People's Commissariats. Although it was intended for the Marshal to remain the dominant authority with this system, it appears that Kosygin has been able to assert himself through his legal and oratory authority to gain a significant position of power within the government, laying the groundwork for what many consider to be greater liberal (or revisionist) reforms to the nation.\n\nDespite this rise in power, Kosygin still finds himself subordinated to Premier Zhukov regarding the final implementation of his ideas, but this should not be misconstrued for the absolute power he held in the initial establishment of our state. Should Zhukov hypothetically oppose one of Kosygin's reforms, he can't simply shut down debate over the issue as was previously the case; instead, he would have to actively work against Kosygin for the party's support within the Supreme Soviet, lest he causes a political crisis using more heavy-handed tactics, something he wishes to avoid in these trying times. Even then, the working relationship between them is still described as largely positive, with Kosygin now having a not-so-insignificant role in the nation's policy."

The validity of these statements has been privately called into question by members of the Politburo, as well as the seemingly genuine nature of the letter, with many suspecting it as a thinly veiled attempt at maintaining the status quo of the military establishment. Although this would be grounds for an investigation into these officers' identities to take disciplinary measures, it is unlikely such an investigation would be able to take place given the lack of proper civilian oversight over the Red Army, not to mention the risk of incurring their wrath ourselves.

The plans set from the centre will be up to greater levels of interpretation by local governments, with local party leaders given more leeway to reach economic goals in a way that works for their local area. Similarly, the running of workplaces will be decentralised, with less power given to single managers and an emphasis of rule by consensus among all workers. As Kosygin emphasises, workplace democracy is the bedrock of socialism, and decision-making in workplaces must be based on the consensus of workers.\n\nThe other key aspect of Kosyginomics is an emphasis on technology. Technological advances have been the greatest driver of increasing productivity in history, and Kosygin is determined that the USSR must catch up with the west technologically in order to catch up economically. Research and development will be bolstered and industries incentivised to upgrade their capital goods.\n\nWhile not a complete departure from the economic planning of the 1930s, Kosygin's proposed package of economic reforms promises to bring significant change to the Soviet economy.

Secure food supplies and supplies of the bare basic goods have been reestablished, and shops are beginning to be better stocked with the things that consumers demand.

This, it is argued, would increase efficiency, as local leadership would have greater knowledge of how best to implement plans in their specific local areas.\n\nOthers, while accepting the need for some level of decentralisation, instead emphasise the need for modernisation. They argue that the model of central planning as it has existed so far can be made even more efficient through reforming its bureaucratic structure and technological sophistication. By bringing in new, fresh-thinking planners and using new communication technologies and computers, central plans can remain the basis of our economy, but be better suited for the modern age.\n\nThe ultimate direction of Gosplan will surely involve some level of both decentralisation and modernisation, but now Party leadership must decide which is the more important reform to emphasise."

Kosygin, a committed communist, was never going to agree to PDR leader Sakharov's wishes for broad movement towards liberal democracy or an end to the primary role of the party in society. He did however agree to make some changes, promising to Sakharov that the social sphere would see limited liberalisation. Censorship and limits on social and cultural expression would be loosened, and the public political sphere allowed some room to grow independent of, but not opposed to, the party's agenda.\n\nBoth men left, if not happy, then at least satisfied.

Though Serov and his allies are still attempting to get the legislation repealed by having the Supreme Soviet refuse to ratify the decree, given the body's precedent of symbolic passage of the Presidium's decrees, it is unlikely to succeed.\n\nAlthough Serov will remain as the head of the MVD, his power within the organization will be significantly diminished, as the new reforms ensure the government's greater oversight and transparency over the MVD, helping to proactively prevent Serov from carrying out any more illegal or unendorsed activities counter to the government's directives. Furthermore, as the new Minister of Internal Security, Serov will be further separated from the secret police and intelligence operations of the MVD, which will now operate more autonomously within the ministry and will report directly to the Council of People's Commissariats and Secretariat of the Communist Party. Comrade Serov's new responsibilities have now been relegated to more traditional policing activities such as the investigation of high-level crimes, the apprehension of criminals and fugitives, managing the internal passport system, and overseeing the operations of the Gulags. Though many of the hardliners within the new MVD still detest these recent reforms and view them as handicapping the Soviet intelligence apparatus, the fact of the matter remains that they lack much of the power and support they once had and are unable to force any reversion in the immediate future."

This move will likely kill any other potential reform attempts for the NKVD for the immediate future, and while it is a setback for the First Secretary, it is unlikely to be fatal, as he maintains a strong support base within the Communist Party, as well as the Council of People's Commissariats, leaving him in a somewhat secure position for the immediate future.

Since the reforms have reflected a long-standing wish of Soviet economic planners, many of these officials have been given amnesty, allowing them to keep their position within the Soviet command economy to oversee the reform's implementation smoothly and efficiently. On the other hand, the average citizen has had a generally positive response to Kosyginism, with many seeing the improvements in their wages given the new focus on the profitability of businesses and the redirection of these profits to worker's bonuses. Although old orthodox party members and supporters may call the entire ideology revisionist, the fact of the matter remains that Kosyginism will be here to stay for the near future, with our citizens' satisfaction (and our budget) to show for it."

 twrkrasnoyarsk_kosygin.19.d:0 "With the rising influence of the First Secretary Alexei Kosygin, one of the most prominent places of opposition within the government is that of the military establishment under the intense scrutiny and control of Marshal Zhukov, who desire the state to remain under his strict supervision for the foreseeable future. Given the sensitive nature of dealing with such a problem, Kosygin has, for the most part, tread a fine line between open antagonism and implementing his reforms, but now that strategy has begun to change. Undermining such a powerbase has been a long and meticulous effort on the First Secretary's part but is now beginning to take shape through the appointment of new civilian Council members around the Premier, via the Supreme Soviet and the Presidium.\n\nThough this represents progress in weakening Zhukov's iron grip over the nation, the military strongmen of the Marshal's Council only account for a fraction of the military's influence, with the rest remaining in the rank and file officer corps the Red Army. Thankfully, that too has begun to fall in line through the appointment of new Political Commissar's to keep conservative officers in line with the central government and avert any kind of insubordination. While Marshal Zhukov still holds a prominent and active position within the military, the primary objective of these procedures was not to completely isolate the Marshal from such activities; instead, it is to help maintain the integrity of the civilian government against opposition from a potentially compromising faction. In that regard, it is working as intended."

Despite Marshal Zhukov's goals to finally achieve victory against the Reich, a sizeable faction of our government has surprisingly come out as against this revanchist agenda, claiming that our resources are better spent on rebuilding the nation after the devastation inflicted from the near-decade of warlordism, as well as the German-Soviet War. When bringing up the fact that the Germans view us as being sub-humans, they will point out how the Nazis have often compromised their racial ideas to gain collaborators within their occupied territories, and with the nation still recovering from the death of Hitler, they may be more reciprocal to resuming diplomatic relations. In the end, it's Premier Zhukov's decision to make."

 twrkrasnoyarsk_kosygin.21.d:0 "The recent reunification of the USSR under Marshal Gregory Zhukov has undoubtedly complicated our plans for reconquering our Eastern Territories. The openly revanchist nature of the new Soviet leader has many within the Wehrmacht on high alert for potential attacks to the east, with the prospect of a Second German-Soviet War being higher than ever. However, something interesting has happened in recent days that has given us a new option in dealing with the USSR, as the new government of the Union has reached out to the Reich Foreign Ministry offering to reestablish the diplomatic ties between our two countries. This comes as a great surprise to us considering Marshal Zhukov's rhetoric, but it appears that this move is motivated by the internal conditions of Russia being unsuited to wage another total war against Germany, thus leading the Soviet leadership to take a more pragmatic approach for the time being. That being said, while the resumption of diplomatic ties between our two nations would go some way to de-escalating tensions, it still does not exclude the possibility of a resumption of hostilities, as the Soviets may simply be trying to lower our guard against an impending attack, not to mention how such a move would also likely forfeit our hard-fought lands to the east."

Concentrated primarily in Vladivostok, these businessmen have seen moderate success in the country, integrating into the city while also providing the Russian people a variety of Chinese-made consumer goods that the domestic market could not supply given the pre-existing industry. Unfortunately, the reclamation of the territory by the Soviet Union has put an end to these operations, as the capitalist nature of these individuals pitted them directly against the Marxist-Leninist philosophy of the government, thus leading the Soviets to begin deporting the businessmen en masse back to China. Reports indicate that shops and properties have already been seized by the Soviets for redistribution, with tens of thousands of refugees being escorted by Soviet authorities to the Chinese border. Though no casualties have been reported from the expulsion, and the government will be more than willing to readmit these citizens back into the country, it undoubtedly leaves a bad mark on our two nations' relations, putting an end to a small but thriving community within the Russian nation."

Ivanov is a man of a special character, a calm look that emphasized a special artistic feature that surpassed everything that was created, and yet disappeared under the radar as if it had never happened. The collection of works that Ivanov left behind also has its charm, and his three books, which marked his authorial career in the greatest resonance, tell a special story for themselves because they are an insight into the political events of a system that strives for unification, which strives for the freedom of all workers, who strive to understand history in a different way, which was not considered in the earlier days or which is, but not in a way that Ivanov could have done. Speaking of his collection of works, those three books must be mentioned, without them, the mind of this author cannot be understood.\n\nThe first book is called "Proletariat: Victory or Sacrifice" and it looks at the events, the beginning, the rise of the ideology of the proletarian dictatorship, its later problem in the face of fascism to be defeated, but never forgotten after the war with the Reich that took the life of the Soviet Union believing that something new will be born after the final return of order to the fallen creation.\n"A Sojourn In Theory" is a novel of a political nature, which sheds light on the ideology that encompassed the Krasnoyarsk region since Zhukov's rise to power and its duration, speaking and defending Zhukov's idea which seemed perhaps the only way for the Soviet Union to return to its wheels. old glory.\nAnd finally, perhaps one of the most intriguing works that came out of his hand, an alt-historical novel called "The Lens Reversed" which listed one of the countless chances and asked the question, "What would have happened if industrialization had arrived in Asia first making it the dominant force and not Europe?" to continue the conversation on the topic - 'what would the proletarian future itself look like if everything happened that way?

It is worth noting the PDR's hatred for the Republic in Vladivostok, who they see as false democrats, puppets of American imperialism. Otherwise, the Party for the Democratization of Russia believes in democracy and republicanism. These traitors must be stopped,  for many years, they lied underground like the rats they are, our Red Army must destroy the PDR if we are ever to stabilize Siberia."

The §gSniper Clique§! also feels that in order to unite Russia, there must be a singular idea of the Soviet man, a patriot who loves his country.

 ps_Vasily_Zaytsev_DESC:0 "§YVasily Zaytsev§!\n--------------\n§gVasily Zaytsev is a renowned Soviet sniper, having a confirmed kill count of over 300 German soldiers. With this renown, and his choice to back the Zhukovites, it was easy for him to gain a political footing in the newly created Soviet government. During this time, he began to formulate the practices of "Traditional Socialism", forming a clique of fellow minded individuals, being commonly referred to as the "Sniper Clique".\n\nSince the formation of this clique, Zaytsev influenced the policies of the Zhukov and the government to enact traditionalist policies. This has however, forced him and the Sniper Clique into a political conflict with the relatively moderate Plurinational Committee of Andrey Vyshinsky for favor with the Marshal."
 ps_Alexei_Kosygin_DESC:0 "§YAlexei Kosygin§!\n--------------\n§gFirst Secretary Of The Party Alexei Kosygin, was born on February 21st 1904, to an ordinary Russian family in St Petersburg. Having lost his mother in his infancy, he and his father grew very close, with Alexei often following in his father's footsteps throughout his early life. This continued when the revolution erupted, as Alexei and his father both sympathized with and supported the Bolsheviks. Joining a labour army during the war, Alexei became a devoted student of Lenin, particularly with regards to Socialist Economics. Thanks to his patronage by Andrei Zhdanov, he rapidly rose through the ranks of the Soviet government following the Great Purge. This continued until the German-Soviet War, when Kosygin oversaw much of the evacuation of industry from the west to the Krasnoyarsk area of Siberia.\n\nThen, Kosygin's life began to rapidly unravel. With the ascension of Kalinin, Kosygin was made the de facto civilian leader of Siberia as Kalinin named he First Secretary of the region. This was due to Kalinin and Kosygin sharing a more modern and progressive understanding of the needs of the Union, and Kosygin's noted competence. It would not last, and with Kalinin's death, Beria's ascension led to Kosygin being purged, with nearly the entire Zhdanov faction. When the Novosibirsk Soviet was formed, Kosygin joined his old menotr Zhdanov as the Party Secretary for Krasnoyarsk. Then The Novosibirsk government further collapsed, and Kosygin's position changed yet again. He now stands as the civilian leader of Marshal Zhukov's government, with the potential to one day achieve full power by sidelining the Marshal himself..."
 ps_Andrey_Vyshinsky_DESC:0 "§YAndrey Vyshinsky§!\n--------------\n§gAndrei Vyshinsky is an older Polish man, who simply wishes what is best for all peoples. Having fled to the USSR earlier in his life, Vyshinsky became a low level party member. After the union split into rival claimants, Vyshinsky and many minorities supported Zhukov, as he had proven less repressive than any of his rivals. The supporters of these minorities quickly formed a political body known as the Plurinational Committee with Vyshinsky at it's lead.\n\nSince the formation of the committee, Vyshinsky has spent his time applying pressure to Zhukov and the army to enact pro minority policies. This has however, forced him and the Committee at odds with the traditionalist Sniper Clique of Vasily Zaytsev for favor with the Marshal."
