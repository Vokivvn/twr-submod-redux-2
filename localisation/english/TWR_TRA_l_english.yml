    ###Leader###
    KHAN_desc:0 "Veli Kayum-Khan was born on July 15, 1904, the son of a Tashkent merchant who studied at the Faculty of Education, firmly adhering to his nationalist and anti-communist views to participate in one of the anti-Soviet, underground organizations called "Kumek." During 1922, at the suggestion of Fitrat, 70 students were sent to Germany to study, and Veli Kajum was among those students. Arriving in Germany, he finished agricultural school. Returning to Turkmenistan, he continued with his ideas and firmly accepted the rise of the NSDAP in Germany, accepting their ideology as the only valid one. After Shokay was relieved of his duties, Veli Kayum came to his place within the Turkmen Legion, which managed to fight during the Great Struggle, in which all sides took their places to fight for what they wanted. After the disintegration of Turkestan and the formation of new states, Turkmenistan finally fell into the hands of Veli Kayum, which will lead it to its new glory or its even more triumphant collapse."

    ###Events###
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.1.t:0 "A Nation Run by Wehrmacht Veterans"
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.1.d:0 "Though Turks were and still are perceived to be inferior to the so-called Aryan superman, they are far from the bottom of the Nazi racial hierarchy. Since the war, they may have even been moved up a few ranks, thanks to the work of the Turkestan Legion.\n\nOrganized by the Schutzstuffel itself in 1942, this Pan-Turkic army with equally Pan-Turkic ideals was primarily formed by Red Army POWs and volunteers who detested Soviet Rule to fight alongside the Wehrmacht in the name of independence, with their numbers swelling as that possibility became more and more realistic as the war dragged on. Though their combat effectiveness wasn’t particularly notable, 35,000 soldiers united by little more than shared hatred of their enemy proved to be more than enough by the war’s end. With the USSR still alive, if only barely, the Legion made their way home, and attempted to seize control of Turkestan with German tactics and German arms. Though their service was viewed with a manner of national pride for all Turks who were not still loyal to the Union, it was ideological differences and their reputation as a Nazi puppet that drove many away from them, eventually culminating not in them being the professional armed forces of a Pan-Turkic state as promised, but instead just another warlord among several as the young nation shattered, their power base roughly secured in the region of Turkmenistan.\n\nStill, they have not hidden the fact that their ultimate goal is the reformation of their Pan-Turkic nation, and remain as true to such ideals as much as they remain true to their hatred of the Communist ideology. Ruling over Turkmenistan as a sort of small-scale test-run of what their ideal country comprising of all of Central Asia would look like, it is clear they have adopted much of the German ideology from their time as brothers in arms, right down to forming their own Gestapo in the form of the Hisba Military Police. With more military experience than perhaps any other state in the region-though they are completely isolated from all potential allies-they are a force to be reckoned with even without their ties to the Germans...Which, while cooling significantly since the war, are still very much active. It seems that the might of fascism alone may very well be enough to see their dream achieved."
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.1.a:0 "For a united Turkestan!"
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.2.t:0 "Conflicts with the Uzbek Bolsheviks"
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.2.d:0 "A tent on a pasture not far from the local forest was a place where many officers gathered to discuss their plans, so they could talk about what had to be done to fight Bolshevism, pacify local places, or sometimes just find some peace in these difficult days for their region, for their hometown. The officers entered the tent and there were several beds, one hundred and some chairs as the central part of the tent that everyone used while they had a small pile of trees and stones outside where they made coffee or cooked.\n\nPutting their hats on the beds and approaching the table, everyone knew one thing for sure - the war was inevitable at this moment. Everyone could have guessed that even if they were not informed about the current political situation that followed their nation and they knew one more thing, they would have to defend it however they knew how, bearing the scars of communism that remained etched in their memory. They opened a map that was folded, looking at points that, according to reports from the main command, seemed strategically important.\n\n"Okay, we all know what this means, but can we all know what to be prepared for?" The officer began, looking at the others around the table as the two sat in chairs and looked toward the beds, nodding their heads as if to agree. "We've heard information from the General Staff, it seems like they're preparing for war against the Bolsheviks." "Are you sure about that? It could be just propaganda like before.” “No, no, this time I think it's a serious situation…” He said quite confidently, with pride in his voice, which indicated that he wanted this, to believe in it,  the struggle he is talking about and that he will do his best to achieve that goal. "Did you have any ideas that would help us prepare for that, we know it's inevitable, we know it's in front of us so everything could help if we are called to the main command."\n\n"I'll be honest with you, we had a few ideas to help us, we all knew this would come one day, but we didn't expect it to arrive this soon." "Then I'd like to suggest a few ideas if we're gathered here. for that reason." "Which is the main reason we're here, and I hid a few bottles of vodka in bed." "And that's why we always gather here.""
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.2.a:0 "To drink and to win against the Bolsheviks!"
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.3.t:0 "The Ostlegionen Soldiers of Turkestan"
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.3.d:0 "Sitting around the fire they set, holding several bottles of alcohol around them and with the officer at the head of this conversation, the soldiers listened to his stories he had while fighting against Soviet units during the war when the Reich penetrated unstoppably, without any obstacles at first. to create a small stalemate, when they had to fight in a way adopted by the Communists to buy time to save their Mother Russia, but to make it all in vain at the end of the day. Fighting on the very front lines, in the battle for Smolensk in which the Reich took a significant victory, the officer recounted their days and their nights they experienced while a brief ceasefire lasted before a new attack was launched, attacking from all directions and with all the force of the Soviet soldiers who could no longer withstand their blows until their defenses were completely broken. He also told them about how the Wehrmacht treated their units, giving them a lot of freedom, what they could not feel while they were under Soviet guarantee, crushed and broken.\n\nThey looked at him in amazement, imagining in front of them a hero who stood up against his tyrant, decided to put an end to his torture, which he and his people experienced day after day, from week to week, and so on indefinitely, even at the cost of death, seeing almost no other way out. For them, he was a savior, a fighter against evil, one who reached for a long way, to certain death, with no guarantee that he would return, but in the end, he returned to pass on his knowledge, his experiences, his dreams, and everything. his hopes that he could experience as he fought side by side with the Reich and the Wehrmacht who decided to help them in their war for independence."
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.3.a:0 "We still have a lot to learn from people like this, and we have so little time."
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.4.t:0 "The Fragile Supply Line"
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.4.d:0 "The truck reached the controller who invited a soldier to come to him to reconnoiter what was inside with him so they could see if it was safe or if the delivery was what they needed - new pieces of weapons, a few significant pieces of explosives as well as various accompanying equipment that came with the package. The officer accidentally glanced at this truck to see the soldier and the controller checking the gun boxes while the German officer who brought this along with the driver stood a little worried and tired, it seemed like he hadn't even slept for the last few hours, or even days. \n\nApproaching him, he asked him: "Did everything go well? Were there any incidental problems? ”The German officer turned to him, already seeing in his eyes that he had not slept at all for the last few days. "The route we're using now is crowded." "What do you mean?" The officer continued as the German rubbed his eyes, red with fatigue. "I think they tracked us down as far as this route is concerned. Attacks on convoys have become more frequent and we have barely managed to break through here.” “Have you managed to devise any route, a safer route?” “So far we have not devised anything because we sincerely want to deliver these goods in this quantity. as soon as possible so that we can think about it later." "Damn communists, we can't do anything for them… "The officer grumbled, thinking what to do. "Just make sure no one follows the tracks of the truck and you will be safe. If someone is attacked in the middle of the road, they will return fire until they run into another convoy. But there's nothing we can do for now." "I understand, thank you for telling me that.""
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.4.a:0 "I know there won't be sleep for me tonight."
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.5.t:0 "The Speech of Khan"
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.5.d:0 ""Today we are standing here, not in front of me or in front of some politician who longs for a goal that only brings him victory, but we are standing in front of the people of Turkestan who have been under occupation and torture of Soviet animals for decades!" Today we stand here as people as if we are rushing together to grab the new future that is now offered to us because we do not get every day the opportunity to get full support from our friends from the Reich who are ready to support us for this noble goal! What is the goal, every person who is not aware of the danger in front of us would wonder! Our enemy looks at us through the eyes of a bloodthirsty bear that has claws that bury themselves with one light touch, stabs us from shoulder to foot, and leaves us so slow and painful to die without any hope of saving ourselves from that bloodthirsty creature!\n\nWhat is this bloodthirsty bear that threatens us from day to day, every moment of its existence? Communism is supported by our former occupiers! Those who kept us trapped in our own country! They may be communists, but together we suffered under their Soviet boot and are desperate enough for their false pseudo-religious goal to cooperate with the murderers of their people! Veli Kayyum solemnly promises you this today! He will not allow this to happen as long as he is alive and as long as his people live with him! ”A crowd of thousands of soldiers exploded in loud applause greeting their Khan who thanked them for their support, promising to prevent communism to settle in their country and that it can only happen through his dead body."
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.5.a:0 "Words that I could say to you are now said!"
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.6.t:0 "A German Gun in Turkic Hands"
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.6.d:0 ""Do you understand with what honour you have been awarded? Do you see the significance of this moment that you are now attending? Do you feel that weight in your hands? Do you feel the beauty of that powerful and great weapon that warms your hands? Exactly. It is the feeling that gives you the highest quality weapons that the almighty Reich can, with the help of Allah, bring to our region to help us in our holy struggle against Bolshevism which seethes at our very existence. Look now, look at my hands and follow the movements I make. This weapon will be your new friend and you will spend the same amount of time with it as with your comrades you see every day. Now imagine that your friend is made of metal and kills communists with much greater speed and heat coming from the barrel, so imagine one more thing - a German rifle will not be able to let you down while a so-called friend can stab you in the back or to other friends and to join the enemy for the sake of low ideals, low prices and who knows what else! So I stand before you now, I tell you this so that you can draw your own conclusions about this holy war of ours against not our enemy, he is worse than our enemy but against - and may Allah forgive me for the desecration of this word, communist. Remember these words well, and now follow what I am doing because you will need it when we fight the communists!”"
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.6.a:0 "In the war, we go and we will succeed, we just need brave soldiers!"
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.7.t:0 "The West Turkestan War"
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.7.d:0 "As the brigades of Legionaries looked across the border, they could see every aspect of their enemy. Their uniforms, their guns, their lit cigarettes, it was all but clear as day. A young soldier aimed his rifle at one of the soldiers and in a sense of pride and anxiety pulled the trigger. The Uzbek soldier fell quickly dead to the ground as absolute silence overtook the atmosphere for a minute. From the trenches and positions, a loud uproar was heard as thousands of Turkmenistani soldiers charged head first into the enemy as a large human wave. n\n\The Western Turkestan War had begun."
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.7.a:0 "Medal of Bravery for the young soldier."
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.8.t:0 "Officer Coup"
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.8.d:0 "The more radical young officers have launched a soft coup against the administration, asking the leader to step down and allow the young members' ally to become paramount leader."
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.8.a:0 "Detain the plotters."
    twrTurkmenistanPhaseI.8.b:0 "Step down."
