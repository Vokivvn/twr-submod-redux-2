    TWR_Yumjaagiin_Tsedenbal:0 "Born a nomad, Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal became one of the first students in the newly organized public school in Ulaangom, graduating in 1929. Tsedenbal went to Irkutsk to continue his education. He spent about nine years between Irkutsk and Ulan-Ude. He obtained a degree from the Siberian Finance and Economics Institute. After the violent collapse of the Soviet Union, Tsedenbal successfully defeated his political rivals in a brutal power struggle, marking the start of his reign with the brutal motto of 'Development and Order'. He is also noted for cooperating with the Chinese Communist Exiles, using them as a form of elite communist inner circle. Tsedenbal is expected to be the one leader that oversees Mongolia's all-in attempts at rapid industrialization."

    MON_The_Clergy_Our_intelligentsia_desc:0 "While we have moved forward towards socialism, we still remain greatly behind in the education of our people and thus the clergy still holds strong in the items of the sciences. With the clergy holding so much power still, their constant attempts to influence the people are draining our government's energy and power piece by piece."

    MON_The_Khans_Our_Military_desc:0 "Since the ancient times, the Khans have been the rulers of the tribes of Mongolia. Holding military status and power in their hands, they have become the primary source of military personnel for our nation. Of course that provision is in exchange to ever increasing power in the ranks of the Mongolian People's Army."

    MON_Rocky_Pastures_desc:0 "Our nation still remains as backwards as it was before the revolution. Transitioning from Feudalism straight to Socialism on our own and with no foreign support has been extremely slow. Our economy still remains agrarian and the little industry we have is ineffective and extremely outdated. We must improve our economic situation or the Mongolian people will backslide into feudalism."
