 SWE_steel_industry:0 "The Swedish Steel Industry"
 SWE_steel_industry_desc:0 "Swedish iron was a key resource for both the British and Germans during the Second World War. Due to Sweden's neutral status, the country openly traded with Germany despite British protests. Now, years after the war has officially ended, Sweden still plays a key role of providing steel for their trade partners in Europe and beyond."
 SWE_nazi_ties:0 "German Ties"
 SWE_nazi_ties_desc:0 "The relationship between Sweden and Germany is an odd one. While Sweden is officially neutral and Germany respects its neutrality, Sweden did play a key role as a provider of resources to Germany during and after the war. German-Swedish ties are described to be a partnership between the both, but official statements from Swedish Government denies any alignment towards Germany."
 SWE_realpolitik:0 "Sweden's Cards"
 SWE_realpolitik_desc:0 "Sweden has been trying to rebrand itself in recent years, actively attempting to maintain good will with the Toronto Accord while trying their best to not alert Germany. This is a dangerous diplomatic game, but if Sweden plays it right, it could become a major player in European politics and avoid the damage of conflict."

twrsweden.1.t:0 "1952 Swedish General Election"
twrsweden.1.d:0 "The political climate of Europe and the neighbouring Nordic countries has changed Swedish politics. The pressure of Conservatives and Liberals are pressing against the Social Democrat's Realpolitik stand on Germany, while the New Swedish Movement slowly gains popularity from German aid and a radicalizing population. Although many believe that Social Democrats will secure yet another victory in the election, the other 3 contenders have the capability of winning."
twrsweden.1.a:0 "Social Democrats win again!"
twrsweden.1.b:0 "People's win the election with a coalition!"
twrsweden.1.c:0 "Rightist achieve a coalition government!"
twrsweden.1.e:0 "New Swedish Movement wins the election!"
twrsweden.2.t:0 "Social Democrats Victory in Sweden"
twrsweden.2.d:0 "Due to its continued strong popularity, the Social Democratic Party of Sweden has remained as the majority party of Sweden. Prime Minister Tage Erlander has promised to continue the Social Democrats' policies of reform and neutrality within Europe, promising that Sweden will never submit to external forces. And with it, the 1952 Election of Sweden has come to a close, with an unsurprising result."
twrsweden.2.a:0 "Alright."
twrsweden.3.t:0 "People's Victory in Sweden"
twrsweden.3.d:0 "Presumably running on the platform of national sovereignty and less ties with the Nazis, the People's Party has managed to secure a surprising victory in the recent election. The newly elected Prime Minister Bertil Ohlin had accused Tage Engdahl's Social Democratic Party as 'Nazi Sympathizers', but has since retracted the statement shortly after the People's Party's unexpected victory."
twrsweden.3.a:0 "Ah, surprising."
twrsweden.4.t:0 "Rightist Victory in Sweden"
twrsweden.4.d:0 "Running on the platform of national sovereignty and morality, the Rightist Party has managed to strike a surprising victory against the once popular Social Democrats. It is rumoured that this victory was secured thanks to the efforts of extensive campaigning, with political advertisements shaping the Social Democrats as weak, Nazi Sympathizers. The newly elected Prime Minister Jarl Hjalmarson has promised to reduce Sweden's economic dependency on Nazi trade and a new doctrine of 'Swedish Proudism'."
twrsweden.4.a:0 "Ah, the Rightists."
