KAZ_influence_mechanic_descr:0 "Between the two influential leaders of the administration, Vasily Rakov and Andrey Vlasov became a pair of unusual partners working together under extraordinary circumstances. After these two were sent to handle Central Asia by the Lavrentiy Beria regime, they managed to restore order and formed a coalition government, representing the two dominant camps, the Anti-Beria pragmatists and the more traditional socialists, united in their patriotism and hatred towards the current state of affairs.\n\nBut now, with the common enemy out of the equation, both factions seek to establish dominance over the other, ensuring a renewed USSR would be rebuilt in their ideal image."

#### Leader Description ####
Andrey_Vlasov_desc:0 "Born on the 14th September, 1901 to a family of lower class Russians in Western Russia. Andrey Andreyevich Vlasov spent his early life in Theological Schools, only to abruptly join the Red Army when the revolution began. Never particularly ideological, Vlasov climbed through the Ranks due to his ability and lack of enmity with other officers. He then spent much of the 1930s in China, where he was an advisor to the KMT, and where perhaps he gained a distaste for Bolshevism. When the Great Patriotic where occured, Vlasov became a leading General in the defense of the USSR, further climbing the Ranks as other generals were sacked or killed. \n\nBy the end of the War, and Beria's ascension, Vlasov was one of the most powerful generals in the Army. Then Zhukov left, Rokossovsky left, and Konev was sent to Kazan, Vlasov thought he was about to be given Command of the Soviet army. He was not. He was then himself sent to Kazakhstan, to pacify and reintegrate the region, against his will. he has since stewed in his dislike of Beria and Bolshevism, to the point where he has become a true wildcard in the former USSR. He now bides his time waiting for his pacification to end, and for his retunr to Perm, where he will take his rightful place as a new Soviet Marshal."
Vasily_Rakov_DESC:0 "Born on 8th February, 1909 to a working-class Russian family in St. Petersburg. Vasily Ivanovich Rakov's early life was uneventful. The only thing that matters about Rakov is that he attended the Leningrad Military Air School and became an effective military pilot during the Great Patriotic War. Rakov also gained his prominence in his time in Kazakhstan, working with Andrey Vlasov's government to dismantle the tyranny of Lavrentiy Beria.\n\nHis leadership position in the Socialist Wing eventually resulted in his overthrowing of Andrey Vlasov, replacing the pragmatist government with an authentic socialist regime."

#### Ideas ####
KAZ_Vlasov_Fiefdom:0 "Vlasov's Fiefdom"
KAZ_Vlasov_Fiefdom_desc:0 "Loyalty has its perks. Andrey Vlasov picked the most beneficial options during the turbulent period of the Soviet Union. Vlasov chose to stay with the Perm government, gaining the trust of Beria. In exchange, Vlasov was soon appointed as the military governor of Kazakhstan, given full authority to pacify the people as he saw fit."
KAZ_Islamic_Separatism:0 "Islamic Separatism"
KAZ_Islamic_Separatism_desc:0 "After Perm re-established control in parts of Kazakhstan, Anti-Soviet islamic insurgencies sprung up across the region, leading to the need of appointing a military governor. While significant progress has been made against these insurgents, separatism remains to be a prominent issue in the region."
KAZ_Socialist_Disillusionment:0 "Socialist Disillusionment"
KAZ_Socialist_Disillusionment_desc:0 "General Vlasov has made no secret of his contempt for ideology in the past, and this has only increased in recent years. His ideas have permeated much of the Officer Corps, and the military district is increasingly revisionist in nature. However this unique ideology does not mean direct support of capitalism, but as a rejection of what is seen as “Dogmatic Ideology”, in favor of a “Pragmatic Ideology”."
KAZ_Unfinished_Pacification:0 "Unfinished Pacification"
KAZ_Unfinished_Pacification_desc:0 "The military district was established with one direct goal in mind: reunifying Kazakhstan and returning it to Soviet control. While this has been severely hindered and delayed, this is the government’s ultimate goal, and should it be achieved, the USSR would definitely integrate the military district."
KAZ_Vlasov_War:0 "Vlasov's Revolt"
KAZ_Vlasov_War_desc:0 "Comrade Vlasov has chosen to stand against the morally corrupt and decadent regime of Beria in order to bring freedom and true socialism to the people who labour for naught under the Perm Oligarchy!"
KAZ_Vlasov_War_2:0 "Vlasov's Revolt"
KAZ_Vlasov_War_2_desc:0 "Comrade Vlasov has chosen to stand against the morally corrupt and decadent regime of Beria in order to bring freedom and true socialism to the people who labour for naught under the Perm Oligarchy!"

KAZ_punishment_comeback:0 "Beria's Punishment, Vlasov's Comeback"
KAZ_punishment_comeback_desc:0 "Comrade Andrey Andreyevich was sent to Kazakhstan in what was more or less a sort of glorified exile, as Beria sought to solidify his power without taking violent steps. But Kazakhstan is by no means the end. Rather, it is a new beginning for Andrey Andreyevich, who shall use Kazakhstan as a springboard from which to make his return."
KAZ_relgion_for_all:0 "No Exceptions!"
KAZ_relgion_for_all_desc:0 "The religious policy of the Soviet Union is simply one of state atheism; to give preference to any one group would betray this belief, and make us into more of a pseudo-theocracy than a socialist state. We cannot falter in our pursuance of socialism, nor betray Lenin's philosophy - the policy of state atheism must be maintained."
KAZ_muslim_privledges:0 "Special Privileges for Muslims"
KAZ_muslim_privledges_desc:0 "To persecute the majority unjustly is a foolish endeavour, and those who seriously propose doing so in our current situation are missing tsars in their heads. We must work to establish contacts with the Muslim community, and win them over to our rule. After all, we are in great need of friends at this time, and harsh tactics will solve nothing."
KAZ_deadline_approaches:0 "The Deadline Approaches"
KAZ_deadline_approaches_desc:0 "The days of the Kazakh Okrug are numbered, and the time when Perm will demand annexation is coming fast. If we are going to be a strong rival to these fools and crooks, we are going to need to build up our forces, as well as dealing with the issues we face. Let us all unite, so that our glorious motherland can unite, and fight the fascist beast occupying our western lands."
KAZ_people_need:0 "The People Need Us"
KAZ_people_need_desc:0 "One cannot deny that the people of our Soviet Union, and Kazakhstan in particular, are in great need. And the bastards in their ivory towers in Perm have the gall to say that they alone can fix what they alone have done. Ha! We are the guardians of the people, and we can be certain that we shall do all that they expect of us."
KAZ_perm_need:0 "Perm Needs Us"
KAZ_perm_need_desc:0 "The motherland calls - crying out for someone, anyone who is anything close to competent. Decimated by the Perm ensemble and defeat at the hands of the fascist pigs, the Soviet Union needs a leader who can save it from incompetence and terror. Comrade Andrey Andreyevich is the man of the hour, it seems, and we must move to assure that."
KAZ_joint_patrols:0 "Joint Russo-Kazakh Patrols"
KAZ_joint_patrols_desc:0 "If we wish to truly pacify the Okrug, we will not be able to rely on Russians alone. We will need the experience and knowledge of the Kazakhs, who know their native land well and will be able to assist us. Furthermore, doing patrols with the Kazakhs will go a long way in endearing us to the population; it will reduce any appearance of colonialism within our administration."
KAZ_need_time:0 "Professional Patrols"
KAZ_need_time_desc:0 "To speak about things like "equality" and such at this point is, to be quite frank, foolish. We are in no position to be needlessly catering or doing things which are unnecessary and only put us in a worse position. We do not need to ensure that things are totally and equally balanced between Russians and Kazakhs - all we need is professionals."
KAZ_beria_wants:0 "Beria Will Get What He Wants"
KAZ_beria_wants_desc:0 "Comrade Lavrentiy Pavlovich will get as he desires; Aralsk and Perm will once more be in the same Union, without any occupation in the way. The Kazakh issue will soon be solved, once and for all - so let us get to work on this, posthaste. In regards to our Okrug's status, work is a wolf, and we will need to do things as soon as possible in order to stabilise Kazakhstan."
KAZ_diverse_kazakh:0 "A Diverse Kazakhstan"
KAZ_diverse_kazakh_desc:0 "We must be aware that Kazakhstan is by no means a homogenous nation, but one which is home to several Russians, Ukrainians, and Uyghurs in addition to the indigenous Kazakhs. The solution to this is not to force a single culture upon them all, but rather to allow these cultures to coexist in harmony. After all, as Stalin famously said, great Russian chauvinism is a danger not just to the Union's minorities, but to the Union's very existence."
KAZ_homo_kazakh:0 "A United Kazakhstan"
KAZ_homo_kazakh_desc:0 "We must be aware that Kazakhstan is by no means a homogenous nation, but one which is home to several Russians, Ukrainians, and Uyghurs in addition to the indigenous Kazakhs. The solution to this is not to promote these divisions, thus weakening us to our enemies, but to unite under a common front. On a map of the world, it is not Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, Byelorussia, and so on, but the Soviet Union - one nation, united forever in friendship and labour."
KAZ_district_elite:0 "Call Upon the Elites"
KAZ_district_elite_desc:0 "If we wish for military success, then we cannot rely on human waves - a tactic proven to be a failure by the Boxer rebellion and the White armies of the Civil War. We must instead seek to create a fighting force of elite men, who can outwit our enemies at every turn they make. Only in this way can we prove the possibility of military success."
KAZ_call_arms:0 "A Call to Arms!"
KAZ_call_arms_desc:0 "We must assemble all peoples of the Kazakh Okrug, all souls willing to fight for their motherland and for Marxism-Leninism. What we have in terms of elite soldiers, our opponents more than make up for in number. We must assemble a force that is of a similar scale as our foes' own, so that we are on an even playing field."
KAZ_will_i:0 "...And So Will I!"
KAZ_will_i_desc:0 "Comrade Lavrentiy Pavlovich will get as he wants with Kazakhstan; it shall be reunited with Perm. That much can be agreed upon. But it will not be under his watch that these two entities return to each other, but under the political tutelage of General Andrey Andreyevich. We must move to build our strength, so that we may prepare to challenge the fools in Perm who led us to defeat against the Germans."
KAZ_fighting_charity:0 "Fighting with Charity"
KAZ_fighting_charity_desc:0 "If we are to deal with the issues of our Okrug's inhabitants lacking faith, then it is necessary for us to assist the poor, many as they may be. After all, it is clear - if we are to kill the poor, we will be no communists. Let us give the Kazakhs just what they deserve: a helping hand. It is the socialist way, after all, to bring about an equal future, in which all have what they need."
KAZ_fighting_fire:0 "Fighting with Fire"
KAZ_fighting_fire_desc:0 "These people causing issues to our Okrug are a disgusting sort, and do not represent what Kazakhstan means. We must show them Kuzka's mother - the full force of our occupational forces. This "mujahideen", a fascist, theocratic terrorist army straight from the Middle Ages, must go back to where it belongs; the history books."
KAZ_people_sword:0 "Our Sword - The People"
KAZ_people_sword_desc:0 "An army cannot exist without men, and without a sufficiently willing population, there will be no men. In the Kazakh Okrug of today, we have solved such issues, and brought the people of Kazakhstan to our side, as patriots of the Soviet Union. Today, we can say with total honesty that the people are our sword, with which we shall slay the fascist beast."
KAZ_land_factory:0 "Our Factory - The Land"
KAZ_land_factory_desc:0 "No modern state is truly modern without a large industry base; after all, our very own Five-Year Plans and New Economic Plan were created with the purpose of quickening industrialisation. We must look to create a future in which Kazakhstan is completely unrecognisable compared to today. In place of steppes, there shall be highways. In place of villages, there shall be cities. And in place of blacksmiths, there shall be steel mills."
KAZ_bell_tolls:0 "The Bell Tolls"
KAZ_bell_tolls_desc:0 "The time has come for us to bring about the end of the government of fools in Perm. They ultimately do not know what is best for the people, and brought us to national destruction in the patriotic war against fascism. Across the Soviet Union, the bell is tolling, marking the end of an old era, and the beginning of a new one - no longer shall we be ruled by violent, self-centred warlords, but a government of the people."
KAZ_beria_rapist:0 "Beria is a Rapist!"
KAZ_beria_rapist_desc:0 "Lavrentiy Pavlovich is a bastard to the bone, whose crimes and misdeeds are infamous across the land. He is a serial rapist, a child predator, and a secret police director - he is our very own Heinrich Himmler, and with all of Himmler's unhinged behaviours and disgusting acts. It is in the interests of all peoples of the Soviet Union that we denounce this monster in our midst - for he is not simply a revisionist, but a rapist as well."
KAZ_beat_shoe:0 "He Will Taste My Shoe!"
KAZ_beat_shoe_desc:0 "The story is clear now; Lavrentiy Pavlovich and the Perm ensemble are all supporters of the Germans. No people could truly be such fools as to drive their nation to defeat, and continue to drive it further towards oblivion. Arresting these people will do no good; they must be mercilessly killed. Comrade Andrey Andreyevich knows what is truly right to bring us to victory over revisionism, imperialism, and fascism - let us show we are serious."
KAZ_new_friends:0 "Calling Our "New Friends""
KAZ_new_friends_desc:0 "The mujahideen are not exactly our closest or oldest friends, but even they can see that we will without a doubt treat them far better than the bastards in Perm will. Under them, there will be a far-reaching crackdown on any and all Islamic influences. With our velvet glove, we shall bring an era of cooperation between the faiths to our glorious motherland. They will fight on our behalf, and in return, they will receive a more beneficial peace."
KAZ_kmt_casches:0 "Breaking Open KMT Caches"
KAZ_kmt_casches_desc:0 "We have found ourselves an ally in the Republic of China. Possessing a substantial Kazakh minority in their Xinjiang province, and sharing the same revolutionary spirit, they have proven to be warm to the idea of supporting our claim for leadership of the Soviet Union. Perhaps it would be best for us to get some weaponry for them, so that they may aid our struggle for control of Perm."
KAZ_destiny_vlasov:0 "Destiny Favors Vlasov!"
KAZ_destiny_vlasov_desc:0 "If we are going to convince the people of our inevitable victory over the German sympathisers and crooks, we are going to have to do some propaganda. Specifically, we are going to have to convince the faithful that we are backed by the gods. Let us quote Matfey 19:24, as well as the Quran, and show the divine necessity in ending the corruption of Lavrentiy Pavlovich and his friends."
KAZ_soviet_valor:0 "Chinese Steel, Soviet Valor"
KAZ_soviet_valor_desc:0 "The Chinese manufacturing industry is growing rapidly, and this is something that we can use to our benefit. While we are certainly in no position to be making requests to our gracious benefactors, we are in grave need of more weaponry - weaponry that the Chinese can supply. Let us issue this single plea to Nanjing for steel, so that our heavy weaponry will be more devastating to the thieves and defeatists in Perm."
KAZ_death_premier:0 "Death to the False Premier!"
KAZ_death_premier_desc:0 "We cannot take a limp stand in regards to the traitors and crooks who have torn our nation to bits and pieces and brought it to defeat at the hands of the German menace. We must be clear in our intent of what to do with the bastards who govern Perm - trial for corruption, and for treason. They have brought our motherland to the brink of destruction, and for that, the false Premier must hang."
KAZ_vlasov_triumphant:0 "Vlasov is Triumphant!"
KAZ_vlasov_triumphant_desc:0 "We have emerged triumphant over the thieves, fools, and revisionists, and comrade Andrey Andreyevich now sits at the helm of the Soviet Union - for now, headquartered in the provisional capital of Perm. Let us unite our forces for a better future, as we prepare to beat back the western imperialists, fascists, and splitters who seek to tear our nation apart."

KAZ_acquiring_kazakh_land:0 "Moving to Retake Kazakh Lands"
KAZ_acquiring_kazakh_land_desc:0 "The territories to our southern border, occupied by the nascent and struggling Turkestani state, mark a grave failure on our part. Occupied by both Turkestani military forces and a theocratic islamist force referring to itself as the "mujahideen", it is perhaps our greatest military failure, and brings us down more than anything else. Let us begin the process of retaking these lands, so that we can get occupation - and liberation - back on track."
KAZ_drafting_plan:0 "Drafting a Plan of Action"
KAZ_drafting_plan_desc:0 "We must begin to draft plans for the soon-to-be-commenced military attacks against the Turkestani positions on the southern border. Let us look to our military commanders, as well as the prowess and skill of Andrey Andreyevich, for ideas as to what to do in regards to this matter.\n\nA surprise attack on the southeastern flank, and another offensive on Turkestani forces in the west, followed by a pincer attack on Alma-Ata... yes, everything looks good."
KAZ_make_move:0 "Strike!"
KAZ_make_move_desc:0 "The time has come for us to brandish the sword, as we take up arms against the Turkestani occupiers of the rightful territory of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. There can be no more talk - we must seize our republic's southern occupied territories. We will crush these rebels, no matter the cost!"
KAZ_speaking_imans:0 "Speaking with Kazakh Imams"
KAZ_speaking_imans_desc:0 "Following our defeat of Turkestani forces at Ayagoz and Taraz, we have found issues with the mujahideen - theocratic zealots who will do no good to our country if left unchecked. To remedy this, we should meet with the imams of the Kazakh people, and have a good and healthy discussion about their concerns and our solutions. As one bureaucrat has put it, we shall be screaming at each other, but it will be much cheaper and easier than fighting on the battlefield."
KAZ_meeting_fighters:0 "Speaking with Islamic Fighters"

KAZ_west_wind_desc:0 "While America is the home of consumerist capitalism, only a fool does not see that they will win out against the Chinese in the end. Furthermore, with aid from the Americans, we can achieve the goals of comrade Andrey Andreyevich; reconstruction of our Soviet Union and emerging as a new economic power in the next few decades."
KAZ_ford:0 "Ford Factories in Magnitogorsk"
KAZ_ford_desc:0 "The Ford company is one which has served various roles in history in modernising the Soviet nation - we recall the days when comrade Khrushchev sought to modernise the agricultural industry, or when they helped to build Magnitogorsk from scratch. But Ford's hour has come again, this time for an even greater cause: the reindustrialisation of the Soviet nation."
KAZ_IBM:0 "IBM Computers for Our Government"
KAZ_IBM_desc:0 "If we wish to reach the modern age, we must begin the process of storing information in modern and advanced ways. The most obvious way of doing this is, of course, computerising government archives and records. But, as we have little to no domestic computer industry, we must turn to our American allies; IBM, globally-renowned, shall serve as a good organisation with which to advance our goals of computerisation."
KAZ_chinese_benefactors:0 "Our Chinese Benefactors"
KAZ_chinese_benefactors_desc:0 "The Republic of China is a nation which shares in many principles - revolutionary spirit, anti-imperialism, anti-capitalist economics, and opposition to Islamic terrorism. While we could side with the American imperialists, our consciousness says we should do no such thing - instead, we shall stand side by side with our dear Chinese comrades!"
KAZ_sort_out_border:0 "Sort Out Our Borders"
KAZ_sort_out_border_desc:0 "While we have established our alliance with the Chinese, that is not to say there is a perfect agreement between our two nations. Many small border conflicts exist, the product of multiple centuries of not-so-peaceful co-existence. Let us organise a binational conference in order to sort out these disputes in a diplomatic format."
KAZ_mongolian_issue:0 "The Mongolian Issue"
KAZ_mongolian_issue_desc:0 "The issue of Outer Mongolia is perhaps the most pressing one in regards to our border disputes with China. A heavily-contested region since the days of the Romanovs and the Qing, the issue was resolved to a limited extent with the establishment of a communist Mongolia. However, times have changed, and the Mongolian government has outlived its usefulness. Let us resolve this issue in a way that will satisfy both ourselves and the Chinese."
KAZ_world_stage:0 "On the World Stage"
KAZ_world_stage_desc:0 "The fact of the matter is that we are not the superpower we were only a decade ago. We may never reach that point again. But the Soviet Union has come back, and we are not to be trifled with. We shall no longer be the laughing stock of the world, but a respected power. And even if we cannot return to our old standing, we must certainly try our best to meet and surpass those days."
KAZ_three_point_manifesto:0 "The Three-Point Manifesto"
KAZ_three_point_manifesto_desc:0 "Our government is a representative one. But it is not a representative government in the same way as America. Rather, the Soviet government is representative of three matters, which shall be our guiding light in future affairs: the forces of production, the socialist-realist culture that we have sought to instill, and the fundamental interests of the Soviet people in a better, wealthier society. For these points, we shall stand!"

KAZ_staffing_new_government_desc:0 "When we took over Vlasov's corrupt regime, we were left without much in the ways of friendly politicians with which to govern alongside Comrade Rakov.

KAZ_return_latinisation:0 "Return to Latinisation"
KAZ_return_latinisation_desc:0 "One of the Soviet Union's greatest projects was the mass-latinisation campaigns of the dozens of languages in its diverse state. These efforts had not only simplified writing systems increasing literacy rates, but has put us in greater touch with the western powers with which we seek to one day facilitate the seeds of Marxist revolution in. Unfortunately, Stalin had largely ended this program in favour of Russification and Cyrillicization. We should bring the old efforts back if we are to be a more reformed and modern socialist state."

KAZ_union_of_equals_desc:0 "One of the greatest faults of the old Union was that despite the calls for national self-determination, the SSRs of the great Soviet Union were nothing more than chains to a greater Russia.

#### Events ####
KAZ.1.t:0 "Vlasov's Kazakhstan"
KAZ.1.d:0 "When Beria took power in 1946, he felt that there was a distinct possibility of his own deposition in the military - both from the left and the right. So, seeking to deal with such threats without directly purging members of the military, he sent his two foremost rivals within the Red Army to deal with the tenuous situation in the regions bordering the German occupational zone and the nascent Turkestan. To the former went the formidable and brutal Ivan Konev. To the latter went the man of the hour - Andrey Andreyevich Vlasov.\n\nComrade Andrey Andreyevich, despite being a member of the party, is by no means one of its most devoted cadres. Seeing sweeping economic reforms as a necessity for the Union's survival, Vlasov has claimed that the Soviet Union failed, in part, due to the New Economic Plan's failure to go far enough. Vlasov has also sought to make allies with the indigenous Muslim population of Kazakhstan, in the process moving away from previous policies of state atheism.\n\nMuch like Marshal Ivan Stepanovich in Kazan, however, Vlasov is not content with his fiefdom on the steppes of Central Asia. A man of such stature, it is no doubt that he has bigger aspirations - Not only to Perm, but perhaps to Moscow. But can he make a comeback, or shall the name of Andrey Vlasov be relegated to the dustbin of history?"
KAZ.1.a:0 "A fine stepping stone."

KAZ.2.t:0 "The Heir Apparent"
KAZ.2.d:0 "With the fall of Perm, and of the Soviet government, our status as the true heir to the throne of the Soviet Union has been completely cemented. Comrade Andrey Andreyevich is the new premier, and he shall guide our motherland along the path of socialism - to greatness and victory over the fascist menace!\n\nBut there is much work to be done. The union's army is in disarray, plagued by internal conflict and dispute. Vlasov's economic reorganisation is yet to even begin. Splitters, American puppets, and the Germans remain in control of large swaths of our republic. And, as if all that was not enough, the forces of both the Kazan Okrug and Beria's NKVD continue to cause chaos throughout the areas under our control. There is much to be done, indeed - so let the work begin."
KAZ.2.a:0 "The union shall be renewed!"

KAZ.3.t:0 "A Successful Invasion"
KAZ.3.d:0 "We have successfully defeated the forces of Turkestan and their mujahid allies; south Kazakhstan has been liberated from the control of hostile forces, and we are now closer to completion of our Okrug's goals!"
KAZ.3.a:0 "Ura!"

KAZ.4.t:0 "Botched Invasion"
KAZ.4.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, and the labours of our Okrug's greatest military minds (including comrade Andrey Andreyevich himself), our efforts have come to naught, as the Turkestani forces and their mujahid allies have emerged triumphant."
KAZ.4.a:0 "We will come back for them."

KAZ.5.t:0 "Russian Invaders Defeated"
KAZ.5.d:0 "With the will of Allah at our side, we have beaten back the godless communist Russians in their efforts to conquer our northern borderlands. People have taken to the streets in celebration of this victory!"
KAZ.5.a:0 "Inshallah!"

KAZ.6.t:0 "Russian Victory"
KAZ.6.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of us, the mujahideen, and of Allah, it seems that was not enough, and the atheist Bolsheviks have seized our northern borderlands. Our capital is now on the brink of capture, and dark clouds loom over the horizon for our nascent republic..."
KAZ.6.a:0 "What does the future hold?"

KAZ.7.t:0 "Support from Vlasov"
KAZ.7.d:0 "Our efforts to bring all of Turkestan under our grip have significantly advanced as we have received military and economic aid from our allies to the north - Andrey Vlasov and his Kazakh Okrug. With this, we shall be able to begin advancing our nation!"
KAZ.7.a:0 "Thank you, comrades."

KAZ.8.t:0 "Expedition Forces from Vlasov"
KAZ.8.d:0 "Our efforts to bring all of Turkestan under our verdant banner have advanced greatly, for comrade Vlasov and his Okrug have sent several men across the border as "advisers" for our military! These men shall be a benefit greater than any other, and their skill will no doubt prove to be a great thing for us."
KAZ.8.a:0 "Thank you very much!"

KAZ.9.t:0 "Our Fellow Okrug"
KAZ.9.d:0 "Though the Kazakh steppes are desolate, alone, and isolated, we were not alone - alone in our exile, that is. To our west was the Kazan Okrug, made up of people on the opposite side of the spectrum as us; left deviationists and violent, extremist soldiers who threatened Beria's position as head of the party. But now that we are in control, the men who kept Kazan in terror are in our prisons, and we have the power to do as we wish with them. Some have suggested that we pardon one or the other, while others believe that they pose a threat to us, and are better off being properly dealt with. How should we deal with these radical generals?"
KAZ.9.a:0 "Both Konev and Stalin can serve."
KAZ.9.b:0 "Both should be dead, the rest can stay!"
KAZ.9.c:0 "Get rid of Stalin."

KAZ.10.t:0 "Internal Dissidents"
KAZ.10.d:0 "Though Beria's regime kept the people of Perm in terror for years, that is not to say they were without their opponents. Many men stood against them, or, though they did not openly state it, were strongly against his regime. Now that we are in charge, it's our choice as to what to do with them; bring them back to serve the nation, or to not trust these potentially-subversive voices. What shall we choose?"
KAZ.10.a:0 "Crush them all!"
KAZ.10.b:0 "Pardon them."
KAZ.10.c:0 "Put them to good use on the front."

KAZ.11.t:0 "Beria's Illegal Regime"
KAZ.11.d:0 "They were keeping Perm in terror for many years; starting shootouts with local militias, taking bribes from the local government, and holding their men at hospitals and military enlistment offices. No, this was no bandit mafia, but something remarkably similar; the former leadership of the Soviet Union in Perm, headed by Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria. Lavrentiy Pavlovich has already been dealt with, but there are many other people who could prove useful to us, and have claimed they are supportive of comrade Andrey Andreyevich's reformist agenda. What should we do with this scum?"
KAZ.11.a:0 "Let them into the government!"
KAZ.11.b:0 "They will not destroy the union again."
KAZ.11.c:0 "Perform a moderately-sized purge."

KAZ.12.t:0 "Dealing with the NKVD"
KAZ.12.d:0 "The People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs - better known by the acronym of NKVD - was the state terror apparatus of the Stalin and Beria regimes, travelling from house to house and bringing torture and death in its wake. However, many voices within the NKVD have been active in the reformist cause under Lavrentiy Pavlovich, and have now turned to us, saying that they are willing to help us in our efforts. What should we do with these criminals - let them live, or kill the bastards?"
KAZ.12.a:0 "Destroy these parasites!"
KAZ.12.b:0 "They might be useful."

KAZ.14.t:0 "Tukhachevsky's Legacy"
KAZ.14.d:0 "Comrade Mikhail Tukhachevsky was no doubt a revolutionary in the field of military strategy, developing concepts of guerrilla warfare with his "deep battle" doctrine that proved all too prescient with the invasion of our territories by the fascist enemy and subsequent battle waged by our partisan comrades. However, comrade Mikhail Nikolayevich never lived to see his theories bear fruit; he was struck down by Stalin, supposedly as a member of a fascist German conspiracy to remove Stalin and install Bukharin as leader of the Soviet Union. Shall comrade Mikhail Nikolayevich receive a posthumous pardon, or were his more controversial positions too significant to ignore?"
KAZ.14.a:0 "The tanks, worship them!"
KAZ.14.b:0 "Tanks are nothing without infantry support!"
KAZ.14.c:0 "Perhaps a compromise?"

KAZ.15.t:0 "Lessons of the Night Witches"
KAZ.15.d:0 "The 588th Night Bombers Regiment, known to the fascist enemy as the Night Witches, was an all-female bomber regiment which excelled in combat against the fascist enemy. Though ultimately struck down, many of their veterans have survived, and we have sought advice from them on the future of our air force. Many different ideas have come forth, but two have prevailed as the primary concepts; show of force and agility. Which should we pick?"
KAZ.15.a:0 "Might and glory!"
KAZ.15.b:0 "Skills and agility!"
KAZ.15.c:0 "Everything is equally important."

KAZ.16.t:0 "On Partisan Warfare"
KAZ.16.d:0 "The Soviet partisans are perhaps the most outsized heroes of our times; people who stood up and fought on against an apparatus of terror when all hope seemed lost. They are a model for our people, and, more importantly, our military, but there is a critical question - what lessons should be learned from the partisans?"
KAZ.16.a:0 "History will show us what to do."
KAZ.16.b:0 "Let them guide us themselves."

KAZ.17.t:0 "Vlasov's Plan"
KAZ.17.d:0 "Comrade Andrey Andreyevich has proposed two plans for the future direction of the Red Army; the first is asymmetrical warfare, while the second is to directly combat the enemy at any available moment. Which shall we choose in our future battles?"
KAZ.17.a:0 "Cunning as a fox!"
KAZ.17.b:0 "Upfront and direct!"

KAZ.18.t:0 "Rakov's Plan"
KAZ.18.d:0 "Comrade Vasily Ivanovich has proposed a new plan for the future direction of the Red Army; he supports an expansion of the role of air forces, promoting cooperation between air and army forces. Others, however, think that anything which could be done with a combined army-air role could be fulfilled better simply by increasing funding to the army. What should we do?"
KAZ.18.a:0 "Redirect the funds to the army!"
KAZ.18.b:0 "The army should coordinate with the air force."

KAZ.20.t:0 "Bread"
KAZ.20.d:0 "Our union is in a state of famine. Many go hungry, and the starving litter the streets, nothing to their names. We have resources to relieve famine, but have had some level of difficulty in distributing said resources. The rightist faction has proposed to enlist the aid of private individuals and charitable organisations in assisting us in our efforts, but leftists have strongly opposed this, saying it would be a dangerous step towards the return of capitalism."
KAZ.20.a:0 "Perhaps the private sector can help."
KAZ.20.b:0 "Distribution should solely be handled by officials!"

KAZ.22.t:0 "The "Indirect Collaborators""
KAZ.22.d:0 "Among our people, there are some who resisted the fascist occupation of our territories. There are others who worked at their side. Some even remained neutral, hoping to live regardless of who won out. But then there are the others; those who, while not overtly collaborating, knowingly benefitted the fascist enemy in some way. There are cases to be made before or against them; some claim that they did what they had to live, but others argue that they worked with the enemy regardless. What shall we do?"
KAZ.22.a:0 "Let it be water under the bridge."
KAZ.22.b:0 "Please, face the wall."

KAZ.23.t:0 "Beria's REP"
KAZ.23.d:0 "Though Lavrentiy Pavlovich was a traitor and revisionist, we cannot say that he was all bad. One of his primary proposals was the Revised Economic Policy, or REP. The REP proposed limited-scale capitalism in order to help the Soviet economy recover from its period of warlordism. This system, which has many similarities to comrade Andrey Andreyevich's proposals, would give some more legitimacy in the party to his agenda. However, it may also be best to not give Beria's reputation some support, even if it is posthumously. What shall we do?"
KAZ.23.a:0 "Perhaps he wasn't all that bad..."
KAZ.23.b:0 "Say nothing of it."

KAZ.24.t:0 "The Status of Private Enterprise"
KAZ.24.d:0 "The status of private enterprise has one of surprising debate in our government, given our communist system. The rightist faction of the party, headed by Andrey Andreyevich, favours the temporary lifting of restrictions on private businesses, in order to help the Soviet Union more quickly recover from the destruction wrought by a period of de facto civil war and foreign occupation. The leftist opposition has claimed that such a thing is reactionary and revisionist, and would lead to the destruction of communism from within. Which side shall win out?"
KAZ.24.a:0 "It is a necessary evil."
KAZ.24.b:0 "No to capitalism!"

KAZ.25.t:0 "Silver Socialism"
KAZ.25.d:0 "Following our Union's consolidation into a single functioning apparatus, Comrade Andrey Andreyevich calls now for a renewed introspection into the state economy. With this new party decree, old wounds are smarting once more.\n\nAndrey Andreyevich, ever the political diva and pragmatist, sees merit in the economies of state found in the west, and with our Union's begrudging disparity with the west in quality of life for the people, He seeks to increase efficiency of providing for the people, as well as forming the basis to outstrip the west in future. The failure of the former regime's GOSPLAN initiative, and its basterdised offspring forged in Perm, show clear signs of a failure in central planning to provide for the union. Thus it follows, according to Andrey Andreyevich, that the state must do away with these ideological concessions, and focus on market liberalisations in order to foster civilian prosperity and obedience. Ever a visionary, Andrey Andreyevich proposes firstly an end to agricultural collectivisation, followed by experimentation with private enterprises and foreign investment. Andrey Andreyevich's all-encompassing plan however is not without its share of criticism.\n\nVasily Rakov and his clique of hardline devotees to Marxist-Leninist thought have ever proven to be a thorn in Vlasov's side, working in opposition to his plans since the days of the Military Okrug. Now that Russia is whole once again, Rakov implores the Presidium to see the reality of her geopolitical situation. The West encircles the Union from all sides, her situation now more dire than even in 1918. wishing to prevent history from repeating, Vasily Ivanovich's clique pushes for a return to Lenin's war communism. Denunciations of Vlasov's economic drafts as enabling fascism to rot the Union from inside out are commonplace within the halls of power.\n\nA recent debacle occured during a meeting, in which Andrey Andreyevich outlined the importance of purchasing Western-made transport vessels, of which boast tonnages up to six times the largest of our own. Vasily Ivanovich and his band of hardliners personally attacked Andrey Andreyevich for daring to bend to the imperialist powers at be, during Russia's most dire hour. Deliberating for hours on the fine quality of Russian made vessels, Rakov's attacks moved on into the hours of the early morning, ending only after calls to conclude the session.\n\nThe Soviet Union stands at the greatest crossroads in her long and storied history, and history's ghosts are not offering any hope of a second chance at failure."
KAZ.25.a:0 "Flexible and tolerant!"
KAZ.25.b:0 "Authenticity!"

KAZ.26.t:0 "The Minorities"
KAZ.26.d:0 "The Soviet Union is home to many minorities, both linguistically and ethnically. Historically, the Stalin government was a Russian chauvinist one, which sought to repress the voices of non-Russians in the cultural sphere. With our new government having heavy basis in its Kazakh origins, some voices have emerged with the goal of increasing minority representation in government, while others have spoken out, claiming this would make government less equal by giving an advantage to minorities - something which they have called anti-socialist in nature. What shall we do?"
KAZ.26.a:0 "They deserve more rights!"
KAZ.26.b:0 "Minorities? You mean Soviet citizens?"
KAZ.26.c:0 "Token gestures and a compromise position."

KAZ.27.t:0 "The Red Emir"
KAZ.27.d:0 "Our southern comrades in Uzbekistan have been our friends through thick and thin; from our days on the Kazakh steppe, they've been there for us, no matter what. But the union must be reunited. We could send a telegram to our comrades, requesting a formal reunion of our governments - with benefits for him, of course. Or we could do a preemptive strike, going in guns-blazing and ready to fight. What shall we do?"
KAZ.27.a:0 "Time to collect our payment."
KAZ.27.b:0 "Make them a deal."

KAZ.3601.t:0 "Soviet Demands"
KAZ.3601.d:0 "The Soviet Union has issued demands to us via telegram, formally requesting that we rejoin them. How shall we respond?"
KAZ.3601.a:0 "We shall rejoin the union."
KAZ.3601.b:0 "Never!"

KAZ.28.t:0 "Uzbekistan Rejoins the Union"
KAZ.28.d:0 "Thankfully, our Uzbek comrades have taken us up on our offer to rejoin our union - long live our brotherhood of peoples!"
KAZ.28.a:0 "Welcome back, comrades."

KAZ.29.t:0 "The Token Stamp"
KAZ.29.d:0 "Rejoice! Comrade Olimov and the Proletariat of Uzbekistan have agreed formally to join the Union, furthering the cause of Socialism globally. As Uzbek diplomats conclude paper signage in Perm offices, a question still burns inside the Premiers respectively. The question of how to approach Uzbekistani integration is a topic of debate in the presidium. Some offer to accept Uzbekistan's entry into the Union as a semi-autonomous ASSR, a gesture of good will to Comrade Olimov's brave vanguard and their special status of preserving the revolution in Central Asia. Others see pragmatic worth in integrating Uzbekistan directly as a province of the Union, citing economic and social integration with Uzbek peoples as a desirable alternative to further splitting our precarious position as the one remaining Marxist state."
KAZ.29.a:0 "Let's give our comrades some autonomy - a little reward."
KAZ.29.b:0 "One nation, indivisible."

KAZ.30.t:0 "Soviet Union Returns Turkic Terrorists"
KAZ.30.d:0 "Thankfully for us, the Soviet Union has returned Uyghur terrorists, as a show of goodwill. We cannot thank them enough for this handover of terrorist insurgents, and we have expressed our sincerest thanks to our neighbours for this."
KAZ.30.a:0 "We thank our dear friends!"

KAZ.31.t:0 "A Socialist Coup"
KAZ.31.d:0 "The faction led by Vasily Rakov has seized control of the government, ousting Vlasov and his clique of pragmatists."
KAZ.31.a:0 "Farewell, spineless pragmatist."

KAZ.32.t:0 "The United Front"
KAZ.32.d:0 "Rakov and Vlasov have set aside their difference for the greater good of the Soviet Union."
KAZ.32.a:0 "The best of both worlds."

KAZ.33.t:0 "Rakov Executed"
KAZ.33.d:0 "Rakov's plot to overthrow Vlasov has been discovered. Subsequently, Vasily Rakov was arrested and executed for treason."
KAZ.33.a:0 "Ambition leads to doom."

KAZ.34.t:0 "The Trial of the Splitters"
KAZ.34.d:0 "Trials have begun in Novosibirsk, the old capital of the self-declared "Second Union", of the leadership of the communists who split from the old Soviet regime. The so-called union, which later split into three, was a large thorn in our side as they sought to retake Russia, but proved to be no match for the might of our Red Army. Of course, we have sought to sentence the entire political leadership of the Second Union to death, or at least life in prison, but there is the matter of the military; some generals have shown to be promising in combat, but the risk exists of actions by these generals against our government. What should we do?"
KAZ.34.a:0 "Issue an amnesty for some, and execute the rest."
KAZ.34.b:0 "Imprison them all!"

KAZ.35.t:0 "The Vladivostok Affair"
KAZ.35.d:0 "With the fall of the American puppet republic in Russia, we have in our hands a great number of political and military leaders of the defeated reactionary state. Most of the leadership, we have decided to execute or sentence to life imprisonment, but two in particular have stood out; Semyon Zakharov and Ivan Yumachev. Both former admirals in the Soviet Union, they later sided with the reactionary forces to save their lives and careers. Treacherous, but completely understandable. Should we let them back in, or kill the traitors where they stand?"
KAZ.35.a:0 "Welcome back, comrades."
KAZ.35.b:0 "Death to traitors!"

KAZ.50.t:0 "Soviet Reunification"
KAZ.50.d:0 "As the guns fall silent across the chaotic Russian landscape, the Soviet Union has emerged united once again, thus marking an end to the warlord era. Led by Andrey Vlasov and Vasily Rakov, the uneasy alliance of the two ideologically-opposed men seek heavy reform of the old Soviet communist system and the USSR's hasty re-entrance as a global superpower. Whether or not the two can co-rule the Union or fall to the factional squabbling of the late Beria government, however, remains to be seen."
KAZ.50.a:0 "Long live the Motherland!"
KAZ.50.b:0 "Interesting."
KAZ.50.c:0 "Cockroaches."

KAZ.51.t:0 "Socialist Coup in USSR"
KAZ.51.d:0 "In a move expected by many, Vasily Rakov and his socialist clique have taken over the entire Soviet government and put former-premier Vlasov under arrest. Announcing an end to Vlasov's "borderline-capitalist revisionist line", Rakov has promised a return to the socialist policies of the old Union, and raproachment with the Union's many disenfranchised minorities."
KAZ.51.a:0 "No more revisionism!"
KAZ.51.b:0 "Interesting."
KAZ.51.c:0 "Bolshevik scumbags."

KAZ.52.t:0 "Pragmatist Coup"
KAZ.52.d:0 "Due to our ideological differences, the Western Soviet administration has launched a coup to overthrow our revolutionary government, replacing it with a friendlier regime."
KAZ.52.a:0 "Wha-..."

KAZ.53.t:0 "Vlasov's New Path"
KAZ.53.d:0 "With that pesky Rakov out of the way, Vlasov can now finally get to work in building his vision regarding so-called "pragmatic socialism". Beliving the transition from capitalism to communism would have to require extensive privatisation first, Vlasov's principles had been initially ridiculed as social democracy by his opponents who now lay either dead or in the GULAGs.\n\nIn any case, now is a good time as any to bring the Soviet people the perfect mix of socialism with Vlasov's own characteristics."
KAZ.53.a:0 "Well then, time to get started!"

KAZ.54.t:0 "On The Union's Minorities"
KAZ.54.d:0 "For decades, the rule of Stalin and Beria had abandoned Lenin's ideas of nationl self-determination and instead gave the Russian chauvinists a voice in the hopes of turning the Soviet Union into nothing more than Greater Russia with red paint. It's time we brought these monstrous practices to an end and reforged our Union into a truly equal union of republics."
KAZ.54.a:0 "Racist opportunists have no place in our Union!"

KAZ.55.t:0 "The New Order"
KAZ.55.d:0 "In our absence, the new global order appears to have coalesced around two main power blocs with which we might potentially be able to work with.\n\nTo the west, the allied powers of the Toronto Accord and their capitalist tendencies remain the largest alliance of Anti-Nazi nations and by far are the biggest controllers of international trade as well. To the east lays the Middle Kingdom under [CHI.GetLeader]. While they are not as economically affluent as the West, they are not only closer to us and have shown signs of rapid growth in recent years."
KAZ.55.a:0 "We will make our mark on the world soon."

KAZ.56.t:0 "Designated Minority Seats"
KAZ.56.d:0 "Seeking to make amends with the minority groups of the Soviet Union, the government has announced a new initiative requiring proportional representation for all minority groups in municipal, district and federal levels of legislature. Hailed as a massive step forward for the voices of the Union's forgotten peoples, the move is expected to make the Union even more democraatic than ever before."
KAZ.56.a:0 "All of the Union's cubs shall be heard."

KAZ.57.t:0 "African Colonialism Criticised"
KAZ.57.d:0 "At a stunning speech in [KAZ.GetCapital], Vlasov railed against Great Britain and the Toronto Accord at large for their apparent hypocrisy regarding democracy and the colonized peoples of the world. "How can London, which claims to hold freedom and liberty as cherished values not give the peoples of Africa equal citizenship and the rights to determine their own destiny?" He said, a line which dominated headlines around the world later the next day. The move will hopefully reposition the [KAZ.GetName] back along the lines of anti-imperialism in which it was founded on."
KAZ.57.a:0 "The world shall be set free!"

KAZ.58.t:0 "The Chinese Border Conference"
KAZ.58.d:0 "Since we have many border disputes with the [CHI.GetName] dating back decades, its time we finally put them to rest in the name of peaceful co-operation betweenn our two great nations."
KAZ.58.a:0 "Let's hope they can be reasoned with."

KAZ.59.t:0 "The Status Of Mongolia"
KAZ.59.d:0 "The legal status of outer Mongolia has troubled Sino-Soviet relations ever since the region formally entered the Soviet sphere in 1921. While we have maintained Mongolian sovereignty since then, the Chinese have continued to claim the region as per the pre-Xinhai Revolution borders dictate.\n\nMongolia is strategically and economically very beneficial to us, however giving the region back to China would go a long way to restoring relations with them."
KAZ.59.a:0 "Mongolia has always been Soviet!"
KAZ.59.b:0 "Mongolia should be Chinese."

KAZ.60.t:0 "The Revisionists Deposed"
KAZ.60.d:0 "With that pesky Vlasov out of the way, it's time we focused back on what matters the most: The human elements of socialism and bringing the power of the Soviet people back into their own hands. We will have to reverse Vlasov's dangerous reforms but most importantly, end the corrupt dictatorial and reactionary ways of the old Union and the warlords as well."
KAZ.60.a:0 "Finally, a Union by and for the people."

KAZ.61.t:0 "Anti-Corruption Trials"
KAZ.61.d:0 "In a long list of trials given tons of media attention, the corrupt and counter-revolutionary elements of the Vlasovite and Permite traitors have been handed the swift justice they deserve.\n\nAs the last gavel struck with a guilty verdict, they were sent to the prisons of Norilsk to live in squalor just as their victims once did to pay their immense debt to Soviet society."
KAZ.61.a:0 "Thus unto revisionists."

KAZ.62.t:0 "Return of the Minorities"
KAZ.62.d:0 "In a move praised by party liberals and ethnic minority politicians, the deportations of Soviet minorities have finally been undone as they were once again allowed to resettle their ancestral homelands. While it may take years or even decades to undo the damage caused in the past, this is surely at least a step forward towards reconciliation."
KAZ.62.a:0 "Welcome home, brothers."

KAZ.63.t:0 "The New Latinisation Initiative"
KAZ.63.d:0 "Seeking to restart the latinisation programs initially started by Lenin, the dozens of languages of the Soviet Union that had initially gone under Cyrillicization and those that see promise in using Latin have once again began teaching and using the new alphabet. Seen as a move towards modernity and away from the reactionary tsarist era, there are even those that are discussing the Latinisation of Ukrainian and Russian now too..."
KAZ.63.a:0 "Excellent."

KAZ.64.t:0 "Pragmatism In All Things"
KAZ.64.d:0 "The term "pragmatic socialism" can apply to more than just the socialist economic system. As we stand, the superpowers of the world now fight each other over the world at large in proxy conflicts. In such a unique atmosphere, the Soviet Union can gain much from being more pragmatic with its foreign policy decisions in a way that promotes socialist ideas.\n\nPerhaps we can win the hearts and minds of the world in the process, as well."
KAZ.64.a:0 "A new foreign policy for a new Union."

KAZ.65.t:0 "Reformed Pragmatic Socialism"
KAZ.65.d:0 "The principles of Vlasov's pragmatic socialism are, while great in theory not the best in practice. Indeed, many of its excesses has led to more problems than fixed solutions. Seeking to moderate these methods, Vlasov has worked closely with Rakov on a solution that will not only promote Vlasov's principles, but will also not go too far as to make us forget our communist commitments."
KAZ.65.a:0 "United, we will be strong."

KAZ.66.t:0 "A Flexible Foreign Policy"
KAZ.66.d:0 "The Vlasov-Rakov formula brings, among other things, a pragmatic foreign policy in which the reborn Soviet Union will partake in. This new take on Soviet diplomacy still retains some elements of classic internationalist policy, like the support of independence movements around the world, and especially in Africa, where decolonization is becoming more and more pressing. Unlike Stalin's isolationist policies, the new pragmatic approach supports cooperation with the rest of the world, being willing to join the United Nations and establish cordial relations with most foreign powers.\n\nThe strangest part of this new diplomatic pack of policies, and one that is particularly hated by the people, is Vlasov's apparent tolerance of the Germans, allowing Germany to exist and even propose a truce with them after the vital territories of the Union are taken back. This specific policy is extremely unpopular among the people of the Union, even state media criticizes the measure."
KAZ.66.a:0 "Only Vlasov and Rakov understand our issues."

KAZ.67.t:0 "A Rare Proposal"
KAZ.67.d:0 ""
KAZ.67.a:0 "Let's take the opportunity."

KAZ.68.t:0 "A Divided Globe"
KAZ.68.d:0 "The World is currently bipolar: near us sits China, long-time rival of Russia, while on the other side of the Bering Strait is the United States, leader of the Toronto Accord, which englobes most of the "free World". It will take decades for our Union to become a superpower of its own, we cannot rebuild completely only by ourselves, thus, our nation must choose an ally.\n\nOn one hand, China is a natural ideological ally which has constantly waged war against both western and Japanese imperialism, managing to become an influential state of its own. On the other hand, America is an economic powerhouse, together with its sphere, they might be more willing to give some much needed foreign aid, as well as other goods necessary for us.\n\nThe Soviet Union must favour one of these two countries if we are to come back to the World stage, who should we pick?"
KAZ.68.a:0 "China, for a world free of imperialism!"
KAZ.68.b:0 "America, for a world free of tyranny!"

KAZ.69.t:0 "A New Red Army"
KAZ.69.d:0 "Our current military situation is dire: our army is poorly equipped and mostly comprised of former warlord militias and mujahideen fighters we were able to align. From these scraps we will build a new Red Army. To do that, however, we must do a few things: Mandatory 7-month military service for all men at the age of 18. The purchase of foreign weaponry, such as tanks, airplanes, guns, trucks, and so on. The rebuilding of our domestic armaments industry. While all these goals seem lofty, we can overcome the odds and build a new Red Army from the ashes of the old."
KAZ.69.a:0 "The Red Army is the strongest!"

KAZ.70.t:0 "An Eastern Approach"
KAZ.70.d:0 "The Soviet Union has been recently reunified under the conjoint premiership of generals Andrey Vlasov and Vasily Rakov, whose armies conquered all of the territories of the Soviet Union that are not currently occupied by Germany.\n\nThe new Union, now constructed on pragmatism and ideological apathy instead of the zealotry soviet socialism historically espoused, has approached us for diplomatic recognition, the new state has made clear its intentions to become the successor to the old Union, and has reached us for recognition as the true government of Russia. Maybe we could get a potential ally out of this proposal, what should we do?"
KAZ.70.a:0 "We shall recognise the Soviet Union."
KAZ.70.b:0 "Never shall we recognise communists!"

KAZ.71.t:0 "The Struggles of Our People"
KAZ.71.d:0 "We have recently invited international organisations to help our state with the measuring of several statistics related to life conditions inside of the Union. They have concluded that poverty in the Soviet Union is at a rough estimate of 70%, with over 20% living in conditions of extreme poverty. Only 6 million households have electricity and running water, among other worrying estimates.\n\nEvery good ruler has to listen to the cry of his people, and comrades Andrey Andreyevich and Vasily Ivanovich are no exception. We, the people, are more than willing to work for the betterment of life conditions inside of the Soviet Union. However, we can't do this on our own. We lack the capital to do so, and for that reason, we will ask foreign countries for international aid. A necessary evil, given our current predicament."
KAZ.71.a:0 "We will fight for bread and roses."

KAZ.72.t:0 "Oil Found in Siberia"
KAZ.72.d:0 "For several weeks, workers have been hard at work all throughout Siberia, drilling. Recently, we got a call from several spots in the Siberian steppes with fantastic news; they have struck oil, with plentiful wells! This is a great discovery - with this black gold, we will be able to rebuild our Union in just a few years. We have ordered more drillings to be done, as well as requesting the construction of wells in areas of discovery."
KAZ.72.a:0 "White snow meets black gold."

KAZ.73.t:0 "No Oil Found in Siberia"
KAZ.73.d:0 "Despite our greatest efforts and most accurate predictions, workers from the State Committee for Oil Industry were not able to find oil in Siberia. This is some unfortunate news, and we will have to depend on coal for energy supply and exports in the coming years. The drillers have been recalled, along with their equipment, and are reported to be coming back home heavily disappointed by their failure."
KAZ.73.a:0 "Unfortunate."

KAZ.74.t:0 "Soviets Admit Our Sovereignty Over Mongolia"
KAZ.74.d:0 "Mongolia has historically acted as a historical buffer state between Russia and China. This has especially been the case since the early 1920s, when the communist regime in the region was established, supposedly neutral but in truth little more than a Soviet puppet state.\n\nHowever, that was by now many years ago; the Union of old is gone, and the curent one is much different. After a series of reunification wars, a co-premiership between generals Vasily Rakov and Andrey Vlasov was established. The new Soviet Union follows a "pragmatic socialism", much less zealous in its pursuit of communism than Lenin, Stalin, or Kalinin. This "pragmatism" can also be seen in their foreign policy: the Soviets have relinquished their guarantee of independence to Mongolia, in what we can only see as a non-apparent move in our favour."
KAZ.74.a:0 "The time has come at last."

KAZ.1310.t:0 "Darkest Hour"
KAZ.1310.d:0 "The madness must end. With the Kazan pretenders seizing the capital and the Perm government incapable of maintaining control, it seems that it is Andrey Vlasov's duty to restore peace and stability to the Soviet Union.\n\nAt a moment's notice, our military will now begin the march northwards, and we shall bring law and order back to our motherland."
KAZ.1310.a:0 "We have to save the motherland!"

KAZ.13101.t:0 "A Very Soviet Civil War"
KAZ.13101.d:0 "The Perm Soviet Government, arguably the most legitimate of all Soviet governments is currently facing an three-way civil war.\n\nInitially, this rebellion was instigated by Kazan Military Okrug commander, [TRV.GetLeader]. But, with Kazan forces gaining the upper hand and successfully capturing Perm, the Kazakh Military Okrug, a previously neutral force has decided to intervene.\n\nNow, three forces are fighting to become the legitimate authority of the biggest Soviet rump, between Kazan commander Ivan Konev, Kazakh commander [KAZ.GetLeader], and General Secretary [SOV.GetLeader]. Due to the delicate balance of power in Central Russia, it is unlikely that the pretenders there would intervene."
