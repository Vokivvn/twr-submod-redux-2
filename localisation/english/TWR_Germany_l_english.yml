 GER_Status_Of_the_Reich_desc:0 "As we enter into a new year, we face the same problems - Not-so-subtle factionalism within the party, an economy in freefall, and a sluggish armed forces. All and all, 1952 has proved to be the worst year for the Reich in recent memory. Moving forward, it is clear that we must tackle these issues head on, as they are slowly killing our nation and threatening to undo all of the progress we have fought so hard to achieve. We shall do whatever it takes - Courting the upper crust of the party, regrettably bending the knee to the demands of those cursed industrial cartels, and executing careful political maneuvering within the Reichstag. We've shied away from being willing to get our hands dirty for a long time, and now we are faced with no other option."
 GER_Internal_Politics:0 "Internal Politics"
 GER_Internal_Politics_desc:0 "Now we must focus on the politics of the interior - mending the current situation we find ourselves in, dishing out the necessary reforms, ensuring (above all things) business as usual, as well as other things. Time is of the essence! We must toil diligently to maintain stability. Lest we become distracted by even a smidgen, then the wretched claws of degeneracy and Judeo-Bolshevism will poke and prod their way into our hallowed institutions. Many meetings will be arranged - For the first time in awhile, the Reichstag shall be put to proper use, rather than the audience for long, rambling, and damn near sleep-inducing speeches!"
 GER_Enforce_Gotenland:0 "Matters of the Eastern War"
 GER_Enforce_Gotenland_desc:0 "Seeming more like a possibility with each week, the aforementioned "Eastern War" is the formal name for the final capitulation of the Soviet Union. Having been left in limbo for quite some time, the USSR has been allowed to lie in wait, entrenching its position while also scheming against the Reich - Taking every possible avenue to weaken our great nation and sow instability in the territories. Well not anymore. Discussed during a closed doors portion the Ostreffen were concise plans of attack on the Soviets, combining both ground and air operations, with the latter aimed specifically at crippling major areas of industrial output, such as the city of Magnitogorsk, a key area of manufacturing operations for the Union. Approved by the OKW, the plan shall be the official order of attack should the war eventually come."
 GER_Osttreffen:0 "Osttreffen"
 GER_Osttreffen_desc:0 "Planned among the higher ups of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht is the Ostreffen, or East Meeting. A large conference among officers leading detachments within the Reichskommissariats and Germany proper, the talks will most likely center on the matters relating to the Eastern War, which will no doubt become inevitable in the near future. Also likely planned is discussions for reforming of the military, a topic which has long been supported by the most senior officers and generals within the Wehrmacht. The conference will likely last for several days, with its outcome having far-reaching effects for all branches of the armed forces going forward. But, as many had already pointed out, the conference was of the utmost urgency - If the Reich's army is to continue to catch up to that of the Toronto Accord."
 GER_Spy_On_The_Inners:0 "Spy On The Inner Party"
 GER_Spy_On_The_Inners_desc:0 "Within the deepest portions of the party lie a class of politicians whose kickbacks and benefits from being the upper crust of the NSDAP have left them privileged - Bold, even. Yes indeed, many of these wine-drinking, endless party-throwing aristocrats are often unwary of their remarks. An off-color joke about the party's positions here, a steaming criticism of legislation there. If we are to ensure the stalwart defense of National Socialism along with its eternal defense from degeneracy and ruin, then there is only one viable option - Allowing the Abwehr full reign to spy on these spoiled bureaucrats. If we are to truly see where the loyalties lie within the highest echelons of the NSDAP, we need only throw on our headphones and listen."

This is a difficult decision for the High Command, as not telling the public will leave them in the dark, and when he does die, there will some people bound to attempt to find out why he died. However, this can also lead to plots to overthrow the Fuhrer while he is sick…"
 GER_Handling_Politics:0 "Handling the Political Situation"
 GER_Handling_Politics_desc:0 "The current situation within our Reich politically is one of the utmost caution - Various factions have been vying for power, their influence growing by the day. Arguments, shouting, and even the occasional brawl between deputies of the Reichstag have grown commonplace in these times. These are troubled waters, with the wind whipping at our faces as a tempest inches further in. But we can only paddle on, hoping that our efforts can lead us to the sun once again. Enact reforms, placate the bureaucrats, do whatever you can. But our institutions must survive and stability be ensured - Then we will bask in the light of our successes when the day comes."
 GER_Ruler_Position:0 "The Ruling Position"
 GER_Ruler_Position_desc:0 "Finally within our laundry list of reforms comes the ruling position of the Reich - the most highest office in all the nation. That of the Führer. Our beloved leader has passed on, leaving behind him a Reich that'd seen brief instability, but made a quick turnaround and continues to be on the mend. But of course there lies the question - Who is the most legitimate to inherit the position? Each man who has formed his own faction, much to our dismay, within the Reichstag has his own ideals for how the Reich should govern itself. But it is only one who can inhabit the Reichskanzlei. So, who could it be?"
 GER_Matters_Of_The_Youth:0 "Matters of the Youth"
 GER_Matters_Of_The_Youth_desc:0 "The Hitlerjugend is the largest youth organization in the Reich - Teaching discipline, a strong work ethic, and pride in one's nation and race for decades now. But alongside our party, the organization has been left mostly unchanged, which has led to the various maladies typical of lacking modernization. Artur Axmann, the longtime leader of the Jugend, has recognized these problems and has consulted with his predecessor, Baldur von Schirach, to discuss various reforms and budget reallocations to improve the functioning of the Jugend. As the party modernizes and reshapes itself, so must our oldest youth organization - So that our nation's children and future generations be instilled with the same values that've kept our Reich strong and proud."
 GER_Living_Spaces:0 "The Lebensraum Question"
 GER_Living_Spaces_desc:0 "No doubt the most pertinent question on the minds of many within government is the official stance on Lebensraum - A core tenet of National Socialism, Lebensraum defines our living space within the vast swathes of land to the east. In our Reichskommissariats, righteous settlers live in the cleansed lands of the former Soviet Union, free to populate the areas that were once tainted with degeneracy and Judeo-Bolshevism. This policy has allowed for us to expand and conquer the weak peoples of Europe and bring our citizens into these virgin lands to erect new cities and reap crops in the name of our Reich. But as of recently, our expansion has stalled, due largely to the instability that previously plagued us. But with the situation improving, perhaps it is time to formally revisit our key policy and its tenets. The Soviet Union still lies beyond our borders, no doubt plotting and conniving to seek its lost lands back. Our opinion on the matter could change the Reich's destiny forever - We mustn't dally."
 GER_Party_Rivalries:0 "SS Rivalries"
 GER_Party_Rivalries_desc:0 "Few could've expected a rivalry to develop in one of the most powerful organizations in the Reich. But strange times make for equally strange occurrences, it seems. Naturally the two opposing sides have coalesced between Heydrich, the Reichskommissar of Gotenland, who favors his own model for the SS's functions, which has served him swimmingly in pacifying the region for Aryan settlement, and Himmler, the current Reichsführer - Who's doctrines have served him adequately thus far. Each man has fiercely entrenched himself in his own visions for how the SS should function going forward, and it is becoming clear that only one shall prove to come out on top. Ultimately however, it is the decision of the Führer to give the ultimate favor out of both men."
 GER_Reinhard_Favoured:0 "Favoured Heydrich"
 GER_Reinhard_Favoured_desc:0 "Out of the endless backroom deals and public debates, it seemed that Heydrich won out as the dust cleared. Having a specifically more extensive (and to some, extreme) outlook on the SS's functions in developing and safeguarding the Aryan homeland, Heydrich has tested his own theories in various places - Bohemia and Moravia, along with his recent posting of Gotenland to name the most prominent ones. And with the latter such principles seemed to have bore fruit, as Gotenland is the top tourist destination within the east for both settlers and citizens of metropolitan Germany alike. The region also shines as a testament to the continuing efforts of Germanization, with a large portion of the peninsula being made up of Aryan peoples. As Himmler's policies drifted towards esotericism and unnecessary things, Heydrich remained committed to the ideals of the SS and a stalwart servant of National Socialism."
 GER_Eastern_Sector:0 "Eastern Sectors"
 GER_Eastern_Sector_desc:0 ""
 GER_Gotenland_Model:0 "Gotenland Model"
 GER_Gotenland_Model_desc:0 "The Gotenland Model is a specific set of policies and doctrines employed by Reichskommissar Reinhard Heydrich during his time within the territory. Committing heavily towards Germanization efforts and the demolition of townships, villages, and even cities that lay antiquated and rife with the stench of degeneracy, the two key policies have provided benefits in droves to the small eastern territory. Within just a few years, Gotenland has developed a thriving tourism industry, achieved levels of Germanization on par with the Reichskommissariat Ostland, and contributed to record levels of stability in all matters of the state. It is no surprise that Heydrich wishes to continue such proposals on a much larger scale, both in Germany proper and her eastern lands. Having the full support of the upper echelons of the SS, Heydrich stands poised to continue to bring greatness to the German nation and the Aryan people."
 GER_Relocate_To_Gotenland:0 "Resettlements to Gotenland"
 GER_Relocate_To_Gotenland_desc:0 "In an effort at further bolstering Gotenland's economic status, Reinhard Heydrich has proposed a series of resettlements of both native Germans and foreign workers in the eastern territories into preexisting towns and new ones, to convert them into various hubs of trade and industrial activity. Seeing Gotenland as a springboard of sorts for imports from Turkey and various lower members of the Mediterranean Pact, despite diplomatic coolness with Rome, the idea would be stupid not to implement. The eastern workers are wholly expendable as well, and if they expire, it is extremely easy to replace them with an Aryan instead - who is likely just as skilled. The benefits to shoring up a larger workforce are numerous, and as such, are far too great to be passed up or tossed on the wayside."
 GER_Himmler_Favoured:0 "Favoured Himmler"
 GER_Himmler_Favoured_desc:0 "As the bickering winds down, it seems that Himmler, the long-expected choice, has won the favor of the Führer. A man committed to his own ideals of the SS's functions, which have served him valiantly during his time in office, has trumped Heydrich's own visions, which were largely uncertain anyway, as they'd been only seen on such a very small scale. Who's to say they wouldn't crack under much larger pressure? Himmler certainly wouldn't. Tried and true methods win out in the end, over those who had only a trial run. That isn't to say Himmler has some own fresh plans of his own - But he also has the most important factor: Patience."
 GER_Himmlers_Vision:0 "Himmler's Vision"
 GER_Himmlers_Vision_desc:0 "The Reichsführer's vision for the SS is one of unwavering honor to National Socialism, loyalty, and the integration of true Aryan history and sciences within society. It was Himmler's own words that said "My honor is my loyalty", and such words must be followed by every proud son of Germany that wishes to enroll in the Schutzstaffel. It is not entirely untrue then to say that such policies should not only be intensely practiced by our organization but by all citizens of the Reich. After all, is that not what the party teaches us? It should be only natural that we fully commit ourselves to it. We must craft a new vision for ourselves - let us read upon the old mythology of the Norse and Pagan Gods, who were true Aryans millennia before we recognized such. Let us throw out the antiquated sciences that still smell of degeneracy and archaic notions. For a German people, every aspect of society should reflect as much!"
 GER_Oversee_Burgundy:0 "Overseeing Burgundy Regions"
 GER_Oversee_Burgundy_desc:0 "The region of Burgundy is one of the utmost importance to the Reich. It is the first line of defense against a possible Accord invasion from France, or even a counterattack from Paris themselves, if they somehow were to wrest themselves from our firm grip. Alongside such practical purposes for its safeguarding, there also exist rich cultural and historical reasons for doing so. The most strongest proponent for the fierce protection of Burgundy has been none other than the Reichsführer himself, who has described Burgundy as an "ancient economic and cultural center", which now in the present lies forgotten, reduced to merely an appendage of France known for its splendid wine production. The Burgundians were, after all, a Germanic tribe, thus immediately rendering them Aryan - It would be foolish not to preserve an important part of the Reich, both strategically and historically."
 GER_Resolve_The_Rivalry:0 "Resolve the SS Problem"
 GER_Resolve_The_Rivalry_desc:0 "Factionalism within the Reich's most important organization cannot stand any longer. If we become bogged down by trivialities, then the hordes of degeneracy and Judeo-Bolshevism will scratch at us until they can eat us alive. Now is the time to act - It is utterly ridiculous, no, downright treasonous even, to continue to undermine the core functions and regular operations of the SS to the point where progress on various projects slows to a crawl. Division is like a cancer, and to fully destroy it we must cut it from its very core. Efficiency within our organization and the ensuring of business as usual is the most imperative issue we face. Now that we stand ready, it's time to resolve this problem once and for all."
 GER_NSDAP_Reforms:0 "The NSDAP Reforms"
 GER_NSDAP_Reforms_desc:0 "The party has been the guiding principle of our society since the inception of the new German Reich. It has become nigh monolithic in nature - Revered by the ordinary citizens in the cities, and the hardworking, soot-covered coal miner in the Ruhr. It has also been feared and hated by the most degenerate enemies of the Reich. But with age comes mileage, and the wear and tear has worn heavily on the NSDAP. As such, the necessary reforms must be undertaken. The party has allowed itself to become bloated, which leads to inefficiency. We must trim the fat in places that have been allowed to gorge for too long - Cut unneeded budgets, shrink some positions here and there, and modernize the bureaucracy. We have spent two years in a most promising decade, but yet our party lags behind. It's time to change that - and quickly."
 GER_Question_Of_The_Guards:0 "Question of the Old Guards"
 GER_Question_Of_The_Guards_desc:0 "Of course, with any matter, therein lies the opinion of the old guard. Those who've stood with us for the longest of time, and supported the party from the humblest of beginnings, all the way back to the disaster of a putsch at a Munich beer hall. Their respect granted, their positions earned - but their ideological convictions fiercely reactionary. The most opposed to change, even if it is to save the ails of the party, the matter most clearly presented to us is what to do with them. Clearly we must continue our reforms at mending fractures within the NSDAP, but if we are to continue doing so, we must take a stand. For better or for worse, something has to be decided upon.The fate of success or ruin lingers upon the voices of the old guard - Should we respect their words, or muzzle them?"
 GER_Mandatory_Membership:0 "Mandatory Membership"
 GER_Mandatory_Membership_desc:0 "For too long there have been millions of low-level functionaries and everyday citizens even, that rub elbows and interact with our party on a daily basis, but are not even full members of it. Such a ridiculous notion! These people surely recognize the glory our ideology has brought unto them, so why do they repay us by not joining? Well, perhaps it is time to force these layabouts to return the favor. A notion that has been popular among many for a long time, mandatory membership would bring in droves of loyal Volk into the NSDAP - perhaps leading to them being encouraged to enroll in the various programs offered, as well as enjoying the benefits we give, such as the more recently revived Strength through Joy travel organization."
 GER_Oil_Reserve:0 "National Oil Reserve"
 GER_Oil_Reserve_desc:0 "Oil, oil, oil. That three letter word has been both a blessing and a curse for our nation. Since the war's conclusion we have operated almost independently from relying on foreign oil markets to meet such needs for it, but there still remains a nagging issue. Due to various concerns from major conglomerates and state-run industries alike, the extraction of oil in areas such as the Kaukasus has not been as efficient, nor as large as it should be. Couple that with a large, but overall merely adequate amount of synthetic refineries dotted across Germany proper, this has contributed to us almost being free from the grip of foreign oil. A simple method to bring us from such woes is to allot further development of synthetic refineries, while also assuring those bureaucratic barons that their assets will be wholly safe from potential sabotage or outright destruction. \n\nBecoming self-sufficient in oil production can boast a great economic and propaganda value for the Reich, so we mustn't let such an opportunity slip any longer."
 GER_Reichsbank:0 "The Reichsbank"
 GER_Reichsbank_desc:0 "A central organ for all economic activity within the Reich, the Reichsbank has seen its fair share of highs and lows in financial growth and decline. Currently, it unfortunately seems to have suffered from the latter. The overall function of the Reichsbank has been left unchanged since the war, preferring to toe the line of status quo, even if it brings negative outcomes, rather than adapt to current situations as the rest of the economy has in these recent times. The simple solution to this is to merely press for organizational reform within the agency, and adopt measures which would overall improve the value of the Reichsmark while also providing necessary benefits for certain financial and general economic sectors that find themselves caught up in a decline or outright failure as well. The Reichsbank is Germany's stepping stone to large-scale economic growth - If it suffers, then the nation suffers."
 GER_Partial_Privatization:0 "Partial Privatization"
 GER_Partial_Privatization_desc:0 "Next on the Four Year Plan's agenda is the first aspect of the final stretch of industrial reform. Several publicly owned industries have suffered from both lowered output, weak efficiency, or in some cases poor administration. As such, a remedy proposed by the Economics Ministry has been the partial privatization of these aforementioned sectors and their handover to the various private industrial conglomerates that we've allowed to operate mostly independent from our gaze. Perhaps it is through the private sector's own expertise with such matters that they can truly shine once more. After all, with such common experience in such a thing, they are likely to be much more flexible in managing such issues."
 GER_Conservative_Appraoch:0 "Conservative Approach"
 GER_Conservative_Appraoch_desc:0 "While we plan a variety of far-reaching reforms towards the economy of the Reich, we must remember to not go overboard. Further liberalization of the economy is a dangerous experiment, one whose potential consequences are far more easier to achieve than its supposed benefits. Executing several reforms in the tried and true fashion of years past has always proven to be suitable and flexible, demonstrating that Germany can bring itself out of an economic slump countless times without relying on so-called liberalization. In a time such as this, it's far too risky to even attempt such. Perhaps at some point in the future, when the Reich is able to face such new ideas without being crippled, they can be allowed to truly shine."
 GER_Labour_Modernization:0 "Labour Modernization"
 GER_Labour_Modernization_desc:0 "Despite our successes, various portions of the methods of labor within the Reich remain antiquated and in some sectors, such as the agricultural industry, downright archaic. As such, we must make a large effort to modernize labor within the nation. Modern farming techniques shall be employed on the fields, industrial refining standards and safety guidelines shall be brought up to speed, and new machinery will be implemented across the board. If the methods of labor remain out of touch with the rest of the world, then our industrial output will suffer because of it. The Reich is held up by its industry - If we falter in our continued efforts to improve it, then we are opening ourselves to weakness."
 GER_Engineering:0 "German Engineering"
 GER_Engineering_desc:0 "Our nation has always been one that stands on the cutting edge of engineering achievements. From the stoic and gargantuan architectural works that dot Germania, topping off with the city's greatest achievement being the Volkshalle, designed from our great Albert Speer from the very beginning, the Reich has never ceased to amaze with its might for innovation. Germany led in engineering before the west wickedly declared us a pariah state, with our finest men in the field sharing their bountiful knowledge with British, French, and even American industrial designers. Our automobile industry pounds out cars by the dozen each day, every one of them as gorgeous as the last - and our tanks, trucks, and planes manufactured to ensure the utmost efficiency in combat. It is time to recapture that spirit of enduring technological achievement once again. German engineering rules supreme over all manner of contraptions across the European continent; It's high time we should genuinely make it so."
 GER_Outsource_Labour:0 "Outsourcing Labour"
 GER_Outsource_Labour_desc:0 "Across Germany there is a practically limitless pool of labor that we can draw from to shore up holes that've been eating up economic sectors elsewhere. From the proud workers of Germany themselves to the foreign workers in the eastern lands, there is always a pair of hands willing to put themselves to laboring for the nation. As such, we think it is only appropriate that we outsource such labor to the the Reichskommissariats, where economic downturn has hit them even harder than Germany itself. By restocking lost labor reserves, we can ensure a streamlined level of growth across all regions of the Reich. It is only through all areas of the nation equally seeing benefits that we can truly strengthen our economy."
 GER_Mass_Productions:0 "Mass Productions"
 GER_Mass_Productions_desc:0 "Production has lagged in recent months, with it having been the main force behind the Reich's economic slump. Consumer goods have declined in both production rates and quality, resulting in a litany of consequences, the most obvious being a lack of spending among the populace, the drastic fall of prices, and the rise of unemployment. As such, it is only natural that we counteract this with the implementation of mass production of a variety of items - Consumer goods, furniture, military supplies, and so on. By mass producing such items, it not only streamlines their assembly, but also rapidly employs workers who require the smallest amount of skill - Ones who otherwise wouldn't be employed in such a setting."
 GER_Concentrated_Industry:0 "Focused Industry"
 GER_Concentrated_Industry_desc:0 "It has been a back and forth that's gone on for as long as economic planners and average citizens alike can remember. Do we favor continued output of consumer goods to boost nominal GDP growth, or continue to build up military reserves, ardent that the Toronto Accord will attempt to breach our shores one day? This flip-flopping has contributed to economic confusion at best, and production slumps at worst. Gearing the industry towards a focused goal can both solve such problems and bolster our standing in the event of such an aforementioned confrontation with the west - Which is likely an inevitability at some point. Naturally, this has been long supported by the various militarist deputies of the Reichstag, the strongest of which being the Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels himself. \n\n"If we cannot be ready to meet the inevitable, then we will never be ready - And Germany's true greatness will forever be barred by ridiculous indecision." - Joseph Goebbels, before a session of the Reichstag on the Four Year Plan's intentions"
 GER_Balanced_Industry:0 "Balanced Industry"
 GER_Balanced_Industry_desc:0 "Where there is balance, there is harmony. Nowhere is this adage more important than industry. By navigating carefully and keeping both consumer and military industry in line with each other, we can achieve a truly strong economy. When one eclipses the other, there is short benefits, but eventually long-term negatives begin to show. Such was apparent in the period of slowdown in the Reich's economy before we spearheaded our far-reaching economic reforms. Now the rhythm has been maintained, and the tune is as sweeter than ever. The quality in consumer goods has returned once more, leading to our citizens spending more, thus strengthening the power of the Reichsmark - creating its own runoff of benefits in the process. \n\nOur toiling has been well-met, further showing that we can triumph under our glorious ideology of National Socialism once more."
 GER_Regional_Stockpiles:0 "Regional Stockpiles"
 GER_Regional_Stockpiles_desc:0 "In the event of a potential showdown with the Toronto Accord, of which is likely to be inevitable, or an outright occupation of our lands by their powers, as unlikely as that could seem, we have devised a plan that would mediate the sting of problems that could occur due to such a thing. Dedicated stockpiles, following the map outline of the Wehrkreise, or military districts, would be set up near major cities or army barracks, to refresh troops in the event of low supplies or faulty equipment. This would allow a sort of "stop-and-go" attitude towards divisions and battalions - Stopping to recuperate and take stock of what the unit is missing, take as needed, and immediately return to the battlefield. \n\nWith few negative aspects, the proposal has been warmly welcomed by party bureaucrats and military officers alike."
 GER_Central_Hub:0 "Central Production Hub"
 GER_Central_Hub_desc:0 "While the industrial status of Germany has always been strong, and more recently thankfully been on the mend with our dutiful reforms to the economy, there hasn't really been a dedicated, central hub for mass production and industrial output. Economic planners have outlined several key areas that would likely fit the bill to form the proposition, mostly cherry-picked from already strongly industrialized cities. From the Rhineland to North Bavaria, Prussia, and even the former areas of the Generalgouvernement, debates as to which area is more suitable (and, to a lesser extent, strategically viable) will likely rage for weeks, before a conclusion is satisfactorily reached. Many of them have favored somewhere that is far from both the western border and the east - a sort of middle ground that could realistically continue heavy military industry output in the event of an invasion or, dare it be said, occupation. Regardless, whatever choice is picked hangs upon the word of the Führer and their own personal favor."
 GER_Military_Reforming:0 "Reforming the Military"
 GER_Military_Reforming_desc:0 "The army of the Reich is the largest in Europe, stalwartly defending the heimat and the far territories of our nation. It has quashed numerous foes and stands ready to thwart even more. But behind all the chest-beating and propaganda posters, there is a creeping element of age within the structure of the Wehrmacht. The last topic to be discussed at the Ostreffen, the reforming of the military into something more efficient and adapting with the times was approved unanimously by senior officers and generals. A multilayered approach, the foremost aspect would be the reevaluation of doctrines utilized during the war, and retrofitting them into the new age. Alongside such would be the adoption of new equipment in every single division within the Reich. Some troops are still carrying rifles issued over 15 years ago! We must reform our Wehrmacht if we are to continue our place as the hegemon of Europe, costs and mutterings of bureaucrats be damned."
 GER_Peoples_Plan:0 "People's Plan"
 GER_Peoples_Plan_desc:0 "The People's Plan, or Volksplan, is a series of market reforms aimed at the citizens of Germany at large. Concentrating on various areas, like reform in the agrarian sectors of the economy, the increased employment within the military sector, as well as other smaller reforms, the plan has been unanimously approved by both the Reichstag and the party elite. Seen as long overdue, the reforms are part of a greater set of large-scale reforms to the economy, with the Volksplan focusing mainly on industrial development in the Reich itself, rather than the eastern territories. Development has lagged in recent years, resulting in a decline in the quality of consumer goods alongside lower purchasing power among German citizens. For a stronger economy, the Volksplan must begin at once."
 GER_New_Four_Year_Plan:0 "New Four Year Plan"
 GER_New_Four_Year_Plan_desc:0 "To inject some much needed activity into the otherwise stagnant economy, a simple solution has already been devised by the Economics Ministry and met with support by the Reichstag - The implementation of new Four Year Plan. Focusing first on financial reform aimed at the Reichsbank and small monetary reform, the plan then transitions into major revamping of the industrial sector, the first planned notion being the expansion of the Reichswerke Hermann Göring. Further down within the Four Year Plan are aims at partial privatization efforts, the modernization of labor methods, alongside rewarding major conglomerates for an increase of production, finally concluding with the formulation of a dedicated central economic hub within the Reich and the gearing towards a more focused industrial sector. Effectively the plan has been set into motion - Merely requiring a dash of the Führer's pen upon its document to formally acknowledge such."
 GER_Idealistic_Germany:0 "Ideal Plan"
 GER_Idealistic_Germany_desc:0 "The Ideal Plan, or Idealer Plan, is the sister project to the Volksplan. Whereas the former focused on employing more into the military production sector and reforming agriculture, while taking a conservative approach on further matters, the Ideal Plan comes in two specific stages - The first being the encouragement of growth within the outskirts of metropolitan areas, the establishment of production quotas within the Reichskommissariats, and the expansion of the greater colonial market. Followed up is the latter section of the plan, which is specifically geared towards increasing national oil reserves alongside setting aside stockpiles of equipment in various regions across Germany. The conclusion of the Ideal Plan is seemingly the most important, focusing on reforming the bureaucracy and maintaining a balance between civilian and military industrial sectors."
 GER_Agrarian_Reform:0 "Agrarian Reform"
 GER_Agrarian_Reform_desc:0 "The agrarian areas of our economy have been largely left unchanged for years. Some will remark it as a good thing, but the downsides are beginning to show underneath the cracks. A lack of crop diversity has resulted in less varied diets in regions across Germany, contributing to higher rates of hunger. Alongside this, the techniques employed themselves within farming remain largely primitive - Few families in the vast farmlands that dot the Fatherland even own a tractor. Antiquated methods allow for lower crop yields, and poor efficiency overall. If we are to maintain a strong nation, the verdant fields must give the entirety of their bounties unto us."
 GER_Propaganda_Work_Ethics:0 "Propaganda Drive"
 GER_Propaganda_Work_Ethics_desc:0 "Improving the economy itself is always important, but alongside such, there lies an equally important aspect - The value of such in propaganda. Each citizen of Germany must believe that they are contributing to the growth of the economy, even in the smallest of actions. We must enlist the best and brightest of Goebbels's Propaganda Ministry to commission all manner of things to reflect such. Stoic posters depicting all workers of the Reich being righteous in their efforts, alongside idolizing the common man for investing in small businesses and the large corporations alike. In the end, the subject of the propaganda is true - Each small action that is done in support of the economy does often benefit the larger whole."
 GER_Warrirors_Industry:0 "Warriors Industry"
 GER_Warrirors_Industry_desc:0 "We are a nation of proud Aryan peoples - Stalwart warriors guiding the nation into greatness and shielding it from the wickedness of the world. This image has been fiercely maintained in all aspects of our nation, giving benefits by the dozen. But there is still some areas in which we have yet been able to capitalize on such an aspect. The most unlikely of which being the industrial sector. Coal miners in the Ruhr, fishermen on the coasts of Prussia, metalworkers in central Germany - All of them have had just as much a hand in reshaping our nation and bringing it to greatness as the soldiers who valiantly and deftly thwarted each of our foes. We would be disrespectful not to award these workers with the same reputation of these men. Everyone in the Reich has had a part to play in the navigation of its path to greatness - They should be cherished as such."
 GER_Benefit_The_Megacorps:0 "Benefit the Conglomerates"
 GER_Benefit_The_Megacorps_desc:0 "The various large, almost monolithic in nature industrial conglomerates that operate under private corporations have long been an important cornerstone within our national economy. They have contributed countless economic growth, expansion of industry, and the continued maintenance of our vast army's equipment reserves. For such a long service to the Reich, such support must be recognized. We must make moves to benefit these conglomerates, award them with further expansions into various markets and lucrative contracts with our various state-run organizations.

 GER_Expand_Reichswerke_Hermann_Goering_desc:0 "The first industrial reform outlined within the Four Year Plan, the expansion of Reichswerke Hermann Göring is not the first of such - In 1937, Reichsmarschall Göring himself began a string of largely successful mergers and budget increases after the removal of Hjalmar Schacht from the position, which brought the Reichswerke into many new economic sectors, such as the military industry. Its main output since then however has still remained geared towards two things - the extraction and processing of ores and the operation of steel mills in the Ruhr. While more efficient than it once was following the reduction of its structure in 1942, the Reichswerke has been no stranger to economic pitfalls that beguile the rest of the economy. As such, the expansion has largely been aimed at the absorption of declining or outright failing industrial plants and the allotment of subsidies or total revamping of their function. Alongside this, Göring has put his own proposal into the expansion plan - The purchasing of coal mines and refineries also found in the Ruhr."

 GER_Encourage_Outter_Metropolitan_Growth_desc:0 "Whilst the main portions of the various large cities that dot Germany contribute as economic hubs themselves, a much different story can be said for the areas that lie just outside of them. Its a common site to see expansive wheat fields, cow pastures, and dairy farms just a stone's throw away from even Germania. Whilst these areas contribute in their own way to economic growth, it is not nearly as large and as varied to that of the cities themselves. An easy solution to which has already been drafted - These farms will be bought out by state-run industries, the farmers granted subsidies as compensation, and their operations moved elsewhere. From then, the areas would be wholly converted to center on industrial operations. Doing this would provide a double-edged sword of benefits - Raising the level of productivity and varied activity to match that of the major cities, while also attracting workers towards these plants, which would in turn grow the land around them into larger townships."

 GER_Expand_RK_Market_desc:0 "The market of the Reich's colonial possessions is often (aside from Gotenland) a vastly untapped region, practically brimming with opportunities for investment and economic growth. This lack of interest has largely been due to an air of animosity from private conglomerates, and curiously enough, state-run industries, citing concerns of long-term stability being the root cause. Nonsense! Gotenland is the most booming economy of a colony we have ever had - Many proud Aryan families have had joyous tourist vacations at resorts on the shores of the Black Sea. The oil reserves in the Kaukasus are bountiful, the industrial plants in Moskowien begging to be subsidized by national conglomerates, and the arable farmland in the Ukraine ripe for more advanced methods of crop harvesting. \n\nIt's stupid to hold back such monumentous investment behind a pitiful veneer of "security concerns".

We cannot ignore that this bloated and inefficient system of bureaucracy must be reformed any longer. Protests of a few scattered Reichstag deputies be damned, if Germany cannot operate an efficient method of bureaucracy, then the whole structure leaves itself to become rotten and fall apart from the inside out. We must make changes at once - If we are to be swift and diligent in our operations, then the benefits will almost certainly be immediate."

Whilst some further amendments have been added since then, it remains largely the same in structure. In fact, the cover pages on some editions of the constitution still bear the old emblem of the previous Weimar government. Proposed several times by various legislators is the obvious implementation of an entirely new constitution - One that throws out the old antiquated articles of our current one, and supplements them with laws that are more suitable to our current government. Of course, the most pertinent of which being the entrenching of the NSDAP and the working class as the sole leadership of the state. With reforms being enacted in a flurry within recent days, perhaps now may be the most perfect time to propose such policy."

The Reich's markets exist solely between Germany proper and the eastern territories, which, although bountiful in key natural resources that we otherwise struggled with during the war, has left us isolated in other areas of imports that exist outside of these trade zones. Attempting even the smallest of trade offers with Rome has been met with stiff-lipped rebuttal, with a similar scene transpiring when von Ribbentrop attempts such with Italy's client states. Along with a isolated trade community, production has lagged behind in various areas, contributing to an overall slowdown in economic activity across the country, which has consequently lead to falling prices and slowly raised unemployment, the first occurrence since the Weimar era. \n\nWe mustn't sit on such a grave issue any longer - Many reforms must come to remedy this, and the return of our economy to normality is the steepest goal we must climb to reach."

Germany dropped the gold standard as far back as 1931, which resulted in the requirement of alternative methods to back hard currency within the Reich. Since then, the economy has made great progress in developing reliable methods for such an occasion. But there still exists a nagging air of uncertainty within these policies. As such, the Reichsbank has outlined plans for further diversifying monetary standards to gradually build up the strength of the Reichsmark within European and potentially global markets. Coupled with that, there also exist plans to revamp lower banking institutions or grant subsidies to those caught in economic slumps. At the initial phase, the plan has seemed to have already showed great promise - and likely will further continue to produce dividends."

Despite areas such as Ostland, the Ukraine, and Gotenland having adequate or above average levels of Germanization, farmers have largely inherited the same tools and same methods that were used by the previous citizenry. The Economics Ministry has laid out proposals to finally introduce production quotas for both industrial and agricultural operations within the Reichskommissariats, hoping that these plans would both quickly drive up productivity, attract more workers to adequately meet such goals, and get the standards in both technology and methods up to par with that of the Reich proper.

There is an easy solution to this, however: We still have many half-tracks from old Waffen-SS units from the days of the war against Bolshevism.

As an all-out assault threatened Moscow, Stalin was forced to relocate his troops away from Stalingrad, opening the door for German intrusion into the Kaukasus oil fields. Stalingrad too fell after an encirclement bled the city dry.

The conquest of all the lands until the Urals was envisioned by Hitler to involve two vital components; the destruction of the Slavic nations and the settling of the territory by German agrarian farmers. The reality is that in the significant post-war economic malaise the already unappealing territories in the East have yet to appeal to the Volksdeutsche demographics. This lack of colonists has become a significant dilemma for those who sought out the ideological pursuit of colonisation across the Reich. While Himmler regards his solution as being worthy of the German veterans, he proposes to expend considerable resources in the expansion of existing Wehrbauer settlement areas with additional incentives for new arrivals such as a free KdF Wagen. In addition to this, Himmler plans systematic targeting of those who are economically deprived and potentially most open for a new life in the East. Heydrich's critique of Himmler's program was vicious - regarding it as an exuberant waste of resources which like all other variants of the existing policy will result in economic stagnation and severe fiscal depletion. This is, his eyes, could simply be solved through the forced relocation of young veterans who can occupy the land, organised so the East can be stabilized as soon as possible. However, those within Germania have suggested that Heydrich's plan would cause potentially major internal dissent in the east and decrease the instability of the Reichskommissariats which would worsen the situation."

This, of course, calls for the Führer to take charge. The Party has been having great difficulties with maintaining stability in certain parts of the eastern Reichskommissariats, and the internal politics of the party is getting more and more sectarian. This can be seen with the development of underground blocs in opposition to the policies of Adolf Hitler, with various rival National Socialist blocs seeking alternative approaches.

Dubbed the "Little Germany of the East" by most who know her, the settlements in Gotenland enjoy peace and tranquility like nowhere in the east. The place where an Aryan man can start a new life in fertile, virgin soil, unbridled by Asiatic partisans after the complete deportation of the old population. A shining example of a model colony, Gotenland clearly proves the superiority of Germany and National Socialism, Reinhard Heydrich explains in front of thousands of applauding spectators in Theoderichshafen's Volkshalle this morning.

gern.18.t:0 "Polish Conspiracy Crushed"
gern.18.d:0 "After a brief but in-depth investigation done by the SD, they reached the conclusion that a sector of Polish Home Army within Warsaw was behind this coordinated attack, with the key clue being the majority of the attacks were conducted by ethnic Poles. With the help of Waffen-SS and Orpo, the Polish rebel stronghold within Warsaw was destroyed, leading to the execution of 59 Polish conspirators. \n\nThe Führer exclaimed that "This is a glorious victory of the just", saying that justice has been served onto these subhumans. And while the population and Outer Party are now at ease, Ernst Kaltenbrunner detailed a possible high ranking figures being co-conspirators, but halting the investigation as of this moment might be the safest."

While many of its terms have been bent or abandoned in all but name in 'emergency' laws to suit National Socialism, the background is still peppered with idiotic ideas of freedom and democracy. Hermann Göring suggested the possibility of drafting a new Nazi consitution to forever uphold the teachings of National Socialism, with the potential benefit of forever enshiring the Führer into Germany.\n\nHowever, after Bormann caught wind of these suggestions, he and his many confidants urged the Führer to reject any attempts by Göring, stating that the words of the Führer are already the foundation of the Germanic nation, and any 'formal' documentation is an attempt of paving way for a future power grab, calling Göring out as a power-craving drug addict."

This article made sure to remind the readers of the deportees' inferiority, but also ensured that these people are living an adequate life under German custody.\n\nWhile most readers often skip these boring sections, the few that cared took this as a sign of relief, knowing that the German master race is doing their best to maintain purity in a humane way.

GOEBBELS_DESC:0 "There is no man within the NSDAP as devoted to its beliefs as Joseph Gobbels. Born to a factory clerk and Dutch migrant, Gobbels was never expected to achieve much out of life. Even less when he began to suffer from bouts of ill health that ultimately resulted in Gobbels' right foot deforming and turning inwards. This deformity prevented Gobbels from fighting for his country in the great war, he spent that time studying literature and history and in his twenties Gobbels attempted to begin a career as an author. His consistent failure in literature coincided with a rise of anti-Semitic rhetoric coming from Gobbels.\n\nBy 1924 Gobbels had been drawn to Hitler and the Nazi party where he regularly spoke at party congresses and arranged rallies for the party, already acting as a propagandist for Hitler. It was during these early years when Gobbels developed a fanatical loyalty towards Hitler. Gobbels' loyalty was rewarded in 1933 when he was appointed as the Reichs Minister for propaganda, a job to which he set about performing with meticulous care. Book burnings, films, exhibitions and radio broadcast Gobbels had full control of all and relished in it.\n\nDuring the war and beyond, Gobbels served as Hitler's mouthpiece, from announcing their glorious victory in Dunkirk to calling upon the people of Germania to defend their Fuhrer during the coup of '48. His political opinions grew ever more radical however as time went on, going even further than the Fuhrer himself by decrying the honorary Aryan policy and calling for a continued war against the 'degenerate' states. Both the people and the party grew increasingly wary of Gobbels and were both equally shocked to discover that he had seized the position of Fuhrer.\n\nNow in command, Gobbels has promised the German people a return to the policies of Hitler and the continuation of his total war, one that shall bring about a Reich that shall last forevermore."
