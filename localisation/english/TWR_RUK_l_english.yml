 ##Focus
 RUK_The_Ukrainian_Civil_War:0 "The Ukrainian Civil War"
 RUK_The_Ukrainian_Civil_War_desc:0 "We should have seen this coming. If only we'd lowered the quotas during the initial grain crisis. There'll be a higher price to pay if we don't crush these rebel ingrates. We were hard on them and they're bound to do the same to us."
 RUK_Emergency_Retreat:0 "Emergency Retreat"
 RUK_Emergency_Retreat_desc:0 "It all happened so fast. Our lines are crumbling with each passing day. There are countless German settlers and personnel stuck in territory we no longer control or are about to lose. We need to evacuate as many of them as possible. We saw what the Banderaites were capable of in Lviv."
 RUK_Form_Ukrainian_Divisions:0 "Form Ukrainian Divisions"
 RUK_Form_Ukrainian_Divisions_desc:0 "We need manpower and we can't afford to be picky. Any native man who's willing to fight in a Waffen-SS brigade or an OUN-M paramilitary squad will be generously awarded should we survive this maelstrom. It's disappointing that we have to lean on the untermensch for assistance, but necessity has forced our hand."
 RUK_Form_the_National_Republic:0 "Form the National Republic"
 RUK_Form_the_National_Republic_desc:0 "The days of RK Ukraine are over. Talks are underway to create an independent Ukrainian state. Today marks the birth of the National Republic of Ukraine. The country may still have a future in the Reich but it will have to be in an altered form. It displeases us that we have to give the natives this much autonomy but they'll still be in our sphere of influence."
 RUK_Negotiate_with_the_Insurgents:0 "Negotiate with the Insurgents"
 RUK_Negotiate_with_the_Insurgents_desc:0 "Starting today, we'll be meeting the top leaders of the insurgencies plaguing this country. Both wings of the OUM and the communists will have to find a way to live with one another. So far the Reich home office is favoring the OUM-M, which is bound to exacerbate tensions with the others. He's not ideal for the Germans' purposes but Melnyk is the only Ukrainian leader they can rely on."
 RUK_United_Against_Tyrants:0 "United Against Tyrants"
 RUK_United_Against_Tyrants_desc:0 "We have kowtowed to the Russians for too long. The fight will continue now that we're in a more advantageous position. For the time being, we're joining forces with Bandera. We'll settle our differences later. First we have to expel these damnable foreign tyrants."
 RUK_Shattered_Peace:0 "Shattered Peace"
 RUK_Shattered_Peace_desc:0 "We've had a break but now it's time to get back into the action."
 RUK_Follow_the_German_Agreement:0 "Follow the German Agreement"
 RUK_Follow_the_German_Agreement_desc:0 "It'd be nice to do this on our own terms but for now it's best to play things safe. We won't be sending quite as much grain to Germania as we did before but they still get a sizable cut, but they'll at least be reimbursing us more than not at all."
 RUK_Free_Independent_Ukraine:0 "Free Independent Ukraine"
 RUK_Free_Independent_Ukraine_desc:0 "Despite the Reich's best efforts, Ukraine is going to be a free nation once more. The Germans are disappointed but some among them think this is for the best. No more of their precious \"Aryan\" blood will be spilled for the time being. They've lucky we're letting them return to Germania with any plunder at all."
 RUK_Total_Retreat:0 "Total Retreat"
 RUK_Total_Retreat_desc:0 "Bollocks to all of this. We tried our best but the situation is out of our hands now. Holding off the rebels isn't possible. A total evacuation of the RK's Aryan settlers and military personnel are underway as we speak. We'll head back to metropolitan Germany and return with an expedition force once this debacle has blown over."
 RUK_The_Ukrainian_Endsieg:0 "The Ukrainian Endsieg"
 RUK_The_Ukrainian_Endsieg_desc:0 "We will never compromise with the rebels. It would be deeply improper of us to bow to their demands. They are genetically and culturally inferior to us in every way. We will go down fighting to prove this cold, undeniable fact. This war can only end when all of us or all of them are bulldozed into a mass grave."
 RUK_Not_One_Step_Back:0 "Not One Step Back"
 RUK_Not_One_Step_Back_desc:0 "We don't negotiate with terrorists, especially not when they're filthy eastern subhumans. We're entering what will very likely be the RK's endgame. We won't retreat and we won't surrender."
 RUK_The_Only_Solution:0 "The Only Solution"
 RUK_The_Only_Solution_desc:0 "They're going to destroy our livelihoods. First they wanted our prosperity because they're too lazy to work and get their own. Now they want the very air we breathe. We have been too kind to these swine while they oppress innocent Aryan men and women. The scales will be balanced."
 RUK_Operation_Vernichten:0 "Operation Vernichten"
 RUK_Operation_Vernichten_desc:0 "If Ukraine is to die then it will die screaming. This country will be as desolate and cratered as the surface of the moon when we are through with it. Everything will burn. The insurgents have brought about the total annihilation of their miserable race. We will take as many of the bastards down with us as our remaining ammunition permits."
 RUK_From_the_Ashes:0 "From the Ashes"
 RUK_From_the_Ashes_desc:0 "The RK lives once more. Now that the fires of war have cooled, the time has come to pick up the pieces. No amount of native partisans can stop the Reich on its inevitable march towards saving the planet."
 RUK_Repair_the_Grain_Industry:0 "Repair the Grain Industry"
 RUK_Repair_the_Grain_Industry_desc:0 "The war decimated the grain industry. We need to set to work at once if we're to restore Ukraine's full agricultural capacity. The output will be low for the time out of necessity. We have to upgrade from a grain trickle to a a proper flow before we can meet pre-war quotas again."
 RUK_Reconstruction_Scheme:0 "Reconstruction Scheme"
 RUK_Reconstruction_Scheme_desc:0 "The damage to the country's infrastructure will take a long time to heal, but heal it must. The RK will be more impervious to harm once its wounds have scarred over. As such, we should invest heavily in the repair of broken roads, powerlines, and other public utilities."
 RUK_Cut_Our_Losses:0 "Cut Our Losses"
 RUK_Cut_Our_Losses_desc:0 "Certain investments we made in the RK prior to the war haven't yielded much fruit. These projects aren't going to bear fruit anytime soon, so it might be for the best if we focused our efforts on new endeavors."
 RUK_Aid_the_German_Settlers:0 "Aid the German Settlers"
 RUK_Aid_the_German_Settlers_desc:0 "It'd be wise for us to lend financial and material support to the RK's settlers. We'll have to work hard if we want to Aryanize this God-forsaken country. We won't have anymore native uprisings if there aren't any natives."
 RUK_Restart_the_Facilities:0 "Restart the Facilities"
 RUK_Restart_the_Facilities_desc:0 "Just as our serfs need to return to the fields, our workers must return to the assembly lines of the RK. It'll be hard on them but we all need to sacrifice a little something for the good of the economy. A resurgence in manufacturing ought to accompany the grain boom that's sure to come."
 RUK_Sense_of_Normalcy:0 "Sense of Normalcy"
 RUK_Sense_of_Normalcy_desc:0 "It's lamentable that averting the RK's destruction required certain fundamental changes to our way of life. Ukraine will never be the same again, but we can pretend that everything is just as it was in the old days. The sooner we get back to business as usual, the sooner the war will become a distant memory. Everything will be normal again as long as we keep saying it is."
