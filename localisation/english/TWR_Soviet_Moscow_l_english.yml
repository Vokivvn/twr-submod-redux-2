 ALEKSANDR_SABUROV_DESC:0 "For Aleksandr Nikolayevich Saburov, the war has not ended. Even after the fall of Bryansk and the establishment of the partisan area in Smolensk, the fight has not ended. And though the position of the NKVD may be weak in Perm, among the Red Army partisans of the West, it is as strong as ever. In Moscow, the spring is no new event, but the culmination of a dozen years of struggle against the fascist menace, now reaching its zenith.\n\nBorn in 1908 to an ethnically-Russian peasant family in Udmurtia, Saburov later moved to Kyiv, and served as head of the fire department, as well as working for the NKVD. Then, in 1941, chaos enveloped the nation, as the Germans launched their invasion. He enlisted, and his unit was encircled and completely destroyed by the Wehrmacht; only six people, including Saburov, survived.\n\nAfterwards, Saburov fled into the woods, and established links with his comrades who were fighting around Bryansk, eventually rising through the ranks to become a leader of the local movement. In the post-war period, following Kaminski's relocation to Bryansk, and purging of partisans in the region, however, they had to flee, and Saburov yet again proved himself, leading the long march to Smolensk. Now, as Moskowien burns down, it is now or never. Saburov will put his name into history, and that much is certain - it is up to him, however, whether it will be as a liberator or as a failure."

 SMO_Death_to_Fascism:0 "Death to Fascism!"
 SMO_Death_to_Fascism_desc:0 "The time has come for a great people's uprising against the fascist enemy which has invaded our motherland and slaughtered our brothers, sisters, mothers, and fathers. The evacuation of our forces to Smolensk will not be a march done in vain, for we rise now, to bring about the final destruction of the German bastards."
 SMO_Freedom_to_the_People:0 "Freedom to the People!"
 SMO_Freedom_to_the_People_desc:0 "The Soviet people cry out for freedom; freedom from the fascist menace which invaded our motherland. Hitler felt that, in beginning his terror campaign against us, that the so-called "rotten structure" of communism would come crashing down. But Hitler was wrong, and we are on the right side of history. We will fight for freedom - freedom of our people from the German oppressor."
 SMO_Tie_Ourselves_to_Perm:0 "Tie Ourselves to Perm"
 SMO_Tie_Ourselves_to_Perm_desc:0 "The government in Perm is our greatest hope for an ally in our struggle to liberate our motherland from the fascist invader. Despite hardship and struggle, they have weathered the rough storms of defeat, and have shown that they will be able to come through for us. We must seek to bring ourselves closer to Perm, and hope that they give us further support in return."
 SMO_Working_With_Our_Comrades:0 "Working with Our Comrades"
 SMO_Working_With_Our_Comrades_desc:0 "Fortunately, we are not the only ones in this struggle against the fascist invaders. Throughout the occupied territories of the Soviet Union, there exist several disparate, but determined insurgent forces fighting the German menace. In this environment, allies are about as easy to come across as a weeping cat; we will work with them, as long as they work with us."
 SMO_Equipment_from_the_Government:0 "Equipment from the Government"
 SMO_Equipment_from_the_Government_desc:0 "If we are to succeed in our struggle against the fascist menace, we are going to need more of everything; we are severely undersupplied from our decade-long insurgent campaign, and captured German supplies do not nearly fulfil our needs. It is necessary for us to request further equipment from the government in Perm, so that Moscow will shine brightly once again."
 SMO_Support_from_the_TsShPD:0 "Support from the TsShPD"
 SMO_Support_from_the_TsShPD_desc:0 "Comrade Panteleimon Kondratyevich Ponomarenko, who has served as the impromptu leader of the antifascist partisan movement since Byelorussia was overrun, has managed a coalition of Red Army forces behind enemy lines, working to establish a cohesive front against the fascist pillagers. However, as the Germans established their iron grip, and the motherland fell into chaos, the Central Headquarters of the Partisan Movement, or TsShPD, fell into disarray. Let us reunite our allies, and fight for liberty!"
 SMO_Execute_the_Collaborators:0 "Execute the Collaborators"
 SMO_Execute_the_Collaborators_desc:0 "The collaborationist bastards are the lowliest of scum, perhaps even lower than the Germans. They are people who have turned their back on their own people in the name of material want, be it riches, power, or hatred. We must strike fear into their hearts, and give them a good example of what is to come. They will know well that when we are victorious, heads will roll, and that they had best run now."
 SMO_Support_Urban_Uprisings:0 "Support Urban Uprisings"
 SMO_Support_Urban_Uprisings_desc:0 "The urban people are the core of our movement and of Marxism-Leninism. They are the proletariat, the bricklayers of our revolutionary foundations, as the Petrograd Soviet emerged from the ashes of the Empire. We call upon those people of the Soviet Union, who live in our cities: rise! Rise, and fight the fascist invader!"
 SMO_Eyeing_Reactionaries_with_Suspicion:0 "Eyeing Reactionaries with Suspicion"
 SMO_Eyeing_Reactionaries_with_Suspicion_desc:0 "We must be wary of our enemies, not just those in plain sight, but those within the lands under the control of our forces. Every person professing reactionary views could be, in truth, an agent for the Germans or the reactionaries, working to harm morale and rising against us when the time is right. Let us watch their every move - when the time is right, we shall strike first."
 SMO_Assist_Our_Partisan_Comrades:0 "Assist Our Partisan Comrades"
 SMO_Assist_Our_Partisan_Comrades_desc:0 "We are not the only ones fighting for liberation; rather, we are united in struggle with our Byelorussian and Ukrainian comrades, who also fight against the fascist Germans and reactionaries who have risen now that the time is convenient. Furthermore, there are also those in the south fighting for the liberation of the Caucasus. All these fighters are our comrades, and we must come to their aid."
 SMO_We_Fight_for_Russia_Alone:0 "We Fight for Russia Alone"
 SMO_We_Fight_for_Russia_Alone_desc:0 "We cannot overextend ourselves for Byelorussia and Ukraine. We must currently focus on the heartland of our union, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Only once we secure Russia fully can we use it as a jumping-off point into other occupied territories to our west. Our comrades may feel betrayal, but we shall emphasise to them that liberation is still coming - just not now."
 SMO_Liberation_is_Our_Aim:0 "Liberation is Our Aim"
 SMO_Liberation_is_Our_Aim_desc:0 "Unfortunately, for now, issues such as ideology and Marxist-Leninist theory must take a backseat to the realities of our situation and military theory. We must focus, first and foremost, on the liberation of our lands from the hands of the fascist invaders, collaborators, and reactionaries who exist as a plague over the people of our motherland."
 SMO_Stoke_the_Flames_of_Patriotism:0 "Stoke the Flames of Patriotism"
 SMO_Stoke_the_Flames_of_Patriotism_desc:0 "The history of the Russian motherland is filled with great men, both revolutionary and reactionary. We must speak of our nation's heroes; not just Lenin, but Pyotr the Great, and Aleksandr Nevsky. In this way, we will bring about a patriotic fervor to repel the fascist enemy from our homeland. Some may call it revisionism, but desperate times call for desperate measures."
 SMO_A_Truce_with_the_Church:0 "A Truce with the Church"
 SMO_A_Truce_with_the_Church_desc:0 "The Russian Orthodox Church is an organisation with which the party does not have good relations, but in these times of anguish, we must forget old grudges. Let us make peace with the church, and unite with them to fight the fascist enemies and support our glorious motherland. To take a harsh stance on a faith so widespread would make us few friends, and many enemies."
 SMO_The_Unthinkable_Alliance:0 "The Unthinkable Alliance"
 SMO_The_Unthinkable_Alliance_desc:0 "Some would say it's treasonous to even think of the thought. Others would call it pure revisionism, and call for a court martial for all of us. But we are fighting a war beyond proportion, and one in which the unthinkable becomes necessary. We must pursue a limited truce with KONR, though it pains us greatly, for the sake of Russia and the war against the German menace."
 SMO_A_Lighter_Hand_on_Reactionaries:0 "A Lighter Hand on Reactionaries"
 SMO_A_Lighter_Hand_on_Reactionaries_desc:0 "We cannot afford to send the security services against every reactionary fellow with our current logistical limits; it is simply an impossibility. Furthermore, if we are to continue harsh persecutions, then we will likely go the way of Stalin - defeated by fascist hands. We must not be so harsh, and allow these voices to exist on a limited scope, in the name of liberating our motherland."
 SMO_Rise_from_the_Countryside:0 "Rise from the Countryside"
 SMO_Rise_from_the_Countryside_desc:0 "The core of our population is not the urbanites, but rather the rural peasantry. Without them, it would not have been possible for us to triumph over the reactionaries during the Civil War, and now their hour has come again. We must establish contacts among the rural villages and forested lands, and conduct a guerrilla campaign against the fascist enemy from there."
 SMO_Throw_Off_the_German_Yoke:0 "Throw Off the German Yoke"
 SMO_Throw_Off_the_German_Yoke_desc:0 "The time for liberation is now or never; we shall either liberate our motherland from the fascist enemy now, or subject our children to a future of untold suffering. We must not submit, and we must fight until the last man - whatever it takes to throw off the German yoke ruling over us, we must do. It is not just us who depend upon it, but all peoples of occupied Europe."
 SMO_I_Never_Really_Was_on_Your_Side:0 "I Never Really was on Your Side"
 SMO_I_Never_Really_Was_on_Your_Side_desc:0 "The KONR has served us well in this truce, but now that the Germans have been cast away, we have no need for peace. They are reactionary to the bone, and we are well aware that this pact with the devil will not last. We will not get fooled again - we shall make the first move in this great game of chess, and quickly put the reactionaries in checkmate."

 smo.1.t:0 "Uprising in Bryansk!"
 smo.1.d:0 "We have received reports of a large uprising in Bryansk. The former headquarters of Soviet Russian partisans, it should come as little surprise that these rebels are reds, swearing fealty to Saburov's red army in Smolensk. We must put a stop to this uprising immediately, for if we do not quell it, it could spread further..."
 smo.1.a:0 "Damn them!"
 
 smo.2.t:0 "Moscow Partisans Indicate Their Support"
 smo.2.d:0 "The Moscow partisans have, thankfully, indicated their support for our government. While by no means unexpected, it is a welcome sign that they are completely willing to work with us. After all, we share a common goal - liberation of the motherland from the fascist enemy."
 smo.2.a:0 "Good, good."
 
 smo.3.t:0 "Moscow Partisans Propose Further Cooperation"
 smo.3.d:0 "Our fellow partisans from the largest Reichskommissariat, Moskowien, have sent telegrams to us with some propositions for further cooperation. They propose arms shipments between us, as well as sharing information on the fascists. What shall our response be?"
 smo.3.a:0 "We're all in this together."
 smo.3.b:0 "We can go on without them."
 
 smo.4.t:0 "[ROOT.GetName] Agrees to Cooperation"
 smo.4.d:0 "Our fellow partisans in the anti-fascist struggle, [ROOT.GetNameDef], have agreed to our ambitious proposals for cooperation - we shall be reaching out, and working with them in our common aim to liberate the Soviet Union from fascist tyranny!"
 smo.4.a:0 "Great!"
 
 smo.5.t:0 "[ROOT.GetName] Refuses Cooperation"
 smo.5.d:0 "Unfortunately, our fellow partisans, [ROOT.GetNameDef], have refused our propositions for cooperation - they instead seek to fight their own war, rather than working with the collective whole for a better future. Come to think of it, that is rather reactionary of them..."
 smo.5.a:0 "It is their funeral."
 
 smo.6.t:0 "Moscow Partisans Request Equipment"
 smo.6.d:0 "Second only to the Belarusians in their size and authority, the Moscow Red Army is in a great position to make requests from us. And now, they have done so, requesting a shipment of military equipment to assist in their destruction of the fascist colonial government in western Russia. Should we fulfil their request, or refuse it?"
 smo.6.a:0 "Of course!"
 smo.6.b:0 "We're a bit tied up at the moment."
 
 smo.7.t:0 "Perm Sends Guns"
 smo.7.d:0 "Our requests for arms shipments from our eastern leadership have been answered in the affirmative; the government in Perm has begun to send shipments of firearms to us, with the aim of assisting our efforts to liberate our motherland."
 smo.7.a:0 "Wonderful!"
 
 smo.8.t:0 "Perm Refuses to Send Arms"
 smo.8.d:0 "Unfortunately, the leadership in Perm has refused to accept our requests for expanded arms shipments, citing the urgent need for them on the home front. We do not see what could possibly be more urgent than the liberation of the motherland from the fascist conquerors, but regardless..."
 smo.8.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 
 smo.9.t:0 "The Killing of Mikhail Oktan"
 smo.9.d:0 "The Soviet Partisans have successfully captured Mikhail Oktan and sentenced to death by a hastily organised kangaroo court."
 smo.9.a:0 "This is terrorism!"
 
 smo.10.t:0 "Uprising in Moscow!"
 smo.10.d:0 "We have received urgent reports that the citizens of Moscow have begun a large uprising against our government, swearing loyalty to the Red Army and seeking to take the city. If we do not adequately deal with this situation, there is a grave possibility that it could quickly spiral even further out of control for us."
 smo.10.a:0 "Deal with them, now!"
 
 smo.11.t:0 "Moscow Partisans Send Aid"
 smo.11.d:0 "Thankfully for us, our comrades to our northeast, [SMO.GetNameDef], have sent us military equipment to assist in our struggle to liberate our motherland from fascist occupation. We shall never forget this great gift!"
 smo.11.a:0 "Thank you, comrades!"
 
 smo.12.t:0 "Reds Propose a Truce"
 smo.12.d:0 "Placeholder"
 smo.12.a:0 "They're a lesser evil than the Germans. Agree to it."
 smo.12.b:0 "No to Judeo-Bolshevism, now and forever!"
 
 smo.13.t:0 "Treason from the Moscow Partisans!"
 smo.13.d:0 "We have received reports that the Moscow partisans are allegedly organising a "temporary" truce with the bootlicking collaborators so that they may together fight the fascist enemy. If this truce is true, it is an act of pure treason on the part of Aleksandr Nikolayevich, and cannot be permitted to stand!"
 smo.13.a:0 "They will pay for these crimes..."
 
 smo.14.t:0 "KONR Refuses Truce"
 smo.14.d:0 "Unfortunately, [RMD.GetNameDef] has refused our offer for a temporary truce in the name of fighting the fascist invaders, citing ideological differences. This means that we will have to fight the Germans on our own, but on the other hand, we will be able to remain loyal to socialism and the Soviet Union."
 smo.14.a:0 "We should have expected as much."
 
 smo.15.t:0 "Uprising in the Forests"
 smo.15.d:0 "The rustling of the trees has proven to be more than wind - from the vast woodlands of Russia, communist partisans have begun to emerge, rising against our rule. We must deal with this sudden threat immediately, for it could quickly reach further into our Reichskommissariat."
 smo.15.a:0 "Damn them!"
