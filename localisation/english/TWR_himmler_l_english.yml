twrheydrichhh.1.t:0 "The Little Black Book"
twrheydrichhh.1.d:0 "Drafted by Reinhard Heydrich and guided by his wisdom, the RSHA has issued a strange order to state publications. With a directive and a clear plan, all printing firms are ordered to publish the 'Der Führer Spricht', provided with the necessary material and script to do so.\n\nDue to its black leather design, this book is nicknamed the 'Little Black Book', this small book is filled with all forms of quotes, words that the Führer has spoken during his lifetime. Designed to be a tool of total loyalty, the Little Black Book is expected to be handed out freely to all citizens of the Reich.\n\nLoyal citizens are expected to be able to recite at least 70% of the book's content at a moment's notice when encountered by Schutzstaffel security checks, failure to do so might result in 'appropriate punishments'. Mass-publishing of the book is now underway."
twrheydrichhh.1.a:0 "Our Führer's light shall guide us forward!"
twrheydrichhh.2.t:0 "A Welcome to Unity"
twrheydrichhh.2.d:0 "Germany is corrupt. Germany was once pure, but it is being manipulated by forces who do not wish well on anyone. For the protection of everyone, these forces must be eliminated. The old regime eliminated the Jews, and other parasites. But by doing so, they have shown the Jews how we think, how we attack, and how scared we are of the world they are pushing us towards. They are not gone, just transformed. They are destroying Germany through other means, through their many puppets. The "Old Guard" has been pushed, in their senility, into the Jew's grasp. The, as they call themselves, "moderates" have done nothing but catalyze the decline of our nation. "Reformists" are Jewish worshippers. It is astonishing how many members of the Reich were, as we have discovered, attempting to create a new Zion out of our humble nation.\n\nHeydrich himself has seen to it that these elements are not only thrown off of Germany's back, but also completely annihilated. Heydrich himself has seen to it that not only will these men never be remembered, they will never have been. Reinhard Heydrich will forever be remembered as our savior. Reinhard Heydrich is our savior.\n\nGermany is perfect. Aryans are perfect people, incorruptible. No Aryan would ever betray the Reich. No Aryan has ever betrayed the Reich. The Aryan people are bounded to a grand brotherhood. This brotherhood is unbreakable, no matter how many times they may attempt to penetrate it.\n\nWe will never not be obedient to Germany."
twrheydrichhh.2.a:0 "My honour is my loyalty."
twrheydrichhh.3.t:0 "Pride in Heydrich"
twrheydrichhh.3.d:0 "What else could one experience than pride? You are experiencing pride. Heydrich can only look on in humble appreciation at this foundation, a nation being rebuilt along the boundaries of reason, justice, and humanity. He is right to do so. Reinhard Heydrich is right. Long has the Schutzstaffel been repressed. They pushed us down, and we were too moral to stop them. We have done nothing but attempt to fulfill a people's destiny. This is destiny. This is the great flaw of being right, those in the wrong manipulate and distort their own perceptions to fulfill our place. The Schutzstaffel is right, they are wrong.\n\nHeydrich can only look on with hope at what we have accomplished. Everything is improving. The Aryan race is being purified, as it was not too long ago that the Aryan race was on the brink of extinction. We can finally be happy again under the Schutzstaffel's righteous hand. Sanguine hours, these truly are. They are.\n\nWe will never not be your people."
twrheydrichhh.3.a:0 "Yes is all I must say."
twrheydrichhh.4.t:0 "The Ministry of Speak"
twrheydrichhh.4.d:0 "What is speech? Only the Schutzstaffel has the answer. The noises and screeches our throat and tongue transform into communicable sound are not what they may seem on the surface as. To prevent them from destroying our society, the Schutzstaffel protects our families. To prevent them from disguising themselves as the ordinary working man, or housewives, the Schutzstaffel must know how they speak, and how they hide their traces. The Schutzstaffel will know.\n\nOur nation is under siege by those who would destroy it. It is under these conditions that the Schutzstaffel is establishing the Ministry. While our strong, Aryan families go about their daily work, bettering our nation, the Ministry will protect you. At points, you may discover machinery, the purpose of which you do not fully understand, or you may hear voices where they should not be. They should be there, and they are. Please, do not hinder the Ministry's good work. Nothing will ever be out of the ordinary. This is ordinary. You understand.\n\nSometimes you may experience delusions, brought on by them. They will be corrected. These delusions vary, from misremembering small details to hallucinating false people. Things may feel confusing, but when you are at your darkest, the Schutzstaffel will be there for you. The Schutzstaffel is here for you. The Schutzstaffel is here. Never forget what we could do.\n\nWe will never not apologize for our minds."
twrheydrichhh.4.a:0 "I'm so, so, sorry."
twrheydrichhh.5.t:0 "Pulcinella's Game"
twrheydrichhh.5.d:0 "What is the Schutzstaffel if not a faithful servant of the Aryan people? The Schutzstaffel believes in us all, and it believes we have the power to continue its quest of strengthening the Reich, even if it is not wholly present. Aryans are a social people, we have mindsets that encourage us to behave ourselves, and to further our standing, unlike them. It is because of our mindset that the Schutzstaffel has entrusted you, the ordinary citizen, to check on and report the behaviors, mannerisms, personality traits, and psychological tendencies of those you encounter in daily life, or elsewhere. You graciously accept such an opportunity.\n\nThere is a number assigned to you and you only, there are others for your family, friends, colleagues, or any other Aryans of the Reich. This number is you. Treat this number as your own limbs, or as your recently born infant child. Status and social standing have always been difficult to understand, and difficult to measure, for ordinary citizens. But, the Schutzstaffel, in its mercy has decided to present to every Aryan of the Reich their position in the universe. Inherently good deeds such as participating in community service, exceeding work quotas, reporting to the Schutzstaffel, supporting the Reich in all of its endeavors, and placing loyalty in our Aryan brotherhood as the top priority in life will increase this number. The Schutzstaffel has not wasted the time creating a list of "wrongdoings." If you are not actively aiding the Schutzstaffel and the Reich, then you are working to destroy it. The number is entropic, stagnancy will only make it worse.\n\nThis number is yours, and yours only, for an important reason. To be loyal to the Reich is to be willing to overturn them, even if they have disguised themselves as colleagues, friends, or family members. To be loyal to the Schutzstaffel is to realize that they never were your colleagues, friends, or family members. To not do so would endanger the number. The number is the Reich's blackguard, and as such, it is willing to take away or destroy if it is not satiated. Watch your infant, the purpose of punishment is to teach.\n\nWe will never not beg the forgiveness of the merciful."

twrheydrichnews.1.d:0 "With Reinhard Heydrich leading Germany, his personal fiefdom of Gotenland shall now be fully integrated, demonstrating that Gotenland has been fully transformed into a pure German region.\n\nGotenland's role shall now be Germany's main port city on the Black Sea, no longer a disconnected colony separated from the German Fatherland."

twrhimmler.1.t:0 "A Total Ban On Books"
twrhimmler.1.d:0 "With all National Socialist related and approved literature being reclassified as official documents, Heinrich Himmler has made a strong statement against any non-governmental literature of all genres. Saying that with Aryans' superior genetics meant superior intellect, making all forms of additional literature useless and having the potential of being turned into propaganda of Jewish-Bolshevism, Heinrich Himmler has declared a total ban on all genres of leisure literature, officially prohibiting citizens from owning unauthorized, non work related books, except for state issued literature and documents. This ban has heavy restrictions on citizens' leisure writing, banning all forms of diaries and leisure writing pieces.\n\nWhile gangs of fanatical Schutzstaffel Youth are now storming everyone's houses for illegal books and engaging in mandatory book burning, the SS has generously allowed some forms of personal writings to be kept if one desires. The only step required is to hand these forms of writings and diaries to the SS, then wait patiently for an appeal process that would take a minimum time of 5 years."

twrhimmler.2.t:0 "The Count of Schwalbennest"
twrhimmler.2.d:0 "In a castle, perched on the edge of a cliff, overlooking a whirling, frothing mass of mist, sits men overdue their deaths. It is the Swallow's Nest, one of Crimea's great monuments, converted into Reinhard Heydrich's personal palace on his orders. Being constructed in Gothic architecture, Heydrich thought it the perfect crown of his new Gotische domain. What was once a beauty, the Swallow's Nest is an ever-expanding monstrosity, hugging the coast like some parasite, and darkening the landscape around it. The waters that night, if it could be seen, held no shade of blue, only black, and entire waves of seafoam. Schutzstaffel banners clung to the castle's walls, and the gates were tightly closed.\n\nInside the Swallow's Nest, it was pandemonium. It was a truly raucous affair; on paper, it was simply an SS staff meeting meant for organizational cooperation, in reality, it was one of Heydrich's infamous celebrations. He would use the opportunity to gather information, collaborate with others on projects, and, most of all, run Gotenland out of the sight of Himmler's prying eyes. This event was special, however. It was the largest of Heydrich's celebrations yet, and it included dignitaries from the Death's Head Formations, the most respected of Waffen-SS veterans, Heydrich's highest-ranking officers of the SD, and other men of status from around the entire Schutzstaffel. It even included members of Himmler's personal staff. The event had become so bloated, there was no way Himmler couldn't know what was happening behind those walls.\n\nLate into the night, once all the deals had been made, and everyone was so drunk that getting to their personal drivers became a challenge, a car drove up to the front gates. For some reason, the guards never even got up to look at the car. A man of average build, wearing a white outfit and mask, stepped from the car and walked to the front doors of the Swallow's Nest. No opposition presented itself. He simply entered the castle's walls, the door wasn't even locked. The man had a gun, but he opted not to use it. Instead, he picked up serving platters, expensive dishware, and champagne glasses. He beat the drunken guests of the party to death in their slumber, but Heydrich could not be found. The man walked out to the castle's balcony, and looking over the edge was Heydrich. Before Heydrich could initiate a conversation, the man lunged at him. They entered fierce combat, teetering back and forth over the Black Sea. The fight was ended once the man picked from Heydrich's chest a medal, rewarding his appointment to head of Gotenland, and beat it into Heydrich's forehead. The mist devoured Heydrich's corpse, while the man just strolled away. The walls were painted red, and the man's mask was near crimson."

twrhimmler.3.t:0 "Our Nicene Creed"
twrhimmler.3.d:0 "You are experiencing psychosis. For a reason that Heinrich Himmler is investigating, symptoms of advanced schizophrenia such as delusions and hallucinations have grown deeply into German society, as the common man fears for his life, tearing down whatever sanity he has left in the barren wasteland of his mind, fearing the worst, fearing if the SS has any dirt against him, fearing the safety of his family, his friends. Whatever you think constitutes the very fabric of reality, it is wrong and it is pointlessly irrational to believe in whatever logical ground this plain of existence holds. The only truth, the only reality, is what Heinrich Himmler says. You are little, so much so that your mind is incapable of comprehending the universe, the world, or even the nation itself. Those who wish to destroy Germany and its great Aryan society are trying to penetrate your mind's fragile defenses and try to tarnish the name of Heinrich Himmler. Heinrich Himmler is the only being that wants the best for you, he does not want to exploit you, but to protect you he necessitates your faith. You will give your faith to Heinrich Himmler.\n\nThe Schutzstaffel has always been unitary. The Schutzstaffel has always been.\n\nHeinrich Himmler is the Schutzstaffel. Because Heinrich Himmler is the Schutzstaffel, it presents no threats and it never will. No Aryan would betray Heinrich Himmler, else they are not Aryan.\nHeinrich Himmler is life. Heinrich Himmler is safety. Heinrich Himmler is glory.\nHeinrich Himmler."

twrhimmler.4.t:0 "Bloodiest Eagle"
twrhimmler.4.d:0 "\"I hereby request a change in post. The conditions in the university have become absolutely unbearable. The spectacled bastard has put in place several mandatory courses, all of which completely obstruct the planned schedule. We are now required to learn about how the world was created through three brothers killing their grandpa, and how they turned his flesh into the soil, and his blood into the ocean, and his skull into the sky. They make us read fairy tales, like the Heliand, or the Poetic Edda, or even so-called 'magical spells' like the Merseburg incantations. When we're not learning about that useless drivel, we're forced into work gangs to find 'hidden archeological objects'. The worst exercise is when they drag us out to some random marsh to extol the benefits of connecting to the primeval energies of our Aryan ancestors, only for half the class to get sick after they walk barefoot for hours through the bogs. Some of those meathead to-be SS officers even go there on their own, albeit just to have drunken swamp parties.\n\nThat, I can handle though. Those courses are not the problem. The problem is what they're doing beyond academia. First it was just little dolls, then it was small animals, but a couple nights ago, they dragged a kid out there. Rumour has it that they threw the kid into the muck, and beat him down whenever he tried to escape.\n\nWhat's worse, its not even safe to be on the streets anymore. We have to limit operations. Churches are being forced to hold dual-worship ceremonies, and have to accommodate new 'traditionalist' altars. Youth groups, led by local SS boy scout captains are on a power trip, and are rumoured to be conducting physical and sexual abuse, with ungodly rumours spreading, which I can personally only hope is dramatisation and falsification. Anyone who's still reasonable are all being sent to their local Wewelsberg. They've constructed these 'castles' everywhere, cult-sites is what they are. They drag you there, and they [REDACTED] until the [REDACTED]. All they leave behind are mutilated corpses, each with Germanic runes carved into them. Apparently, its some form of ritual, going under the label of the 'sacrificial .--. ..- .-. .. - -.--'. What adds to the morbid sense of fear is that you can smell the rotting corpses of those left, with maggots eating their flesh away, leaking yellow-ish puss and blood the next time you visit these castle things. And there was going to be a next time. Himmler made damn sure everyone was going to these damn places. I've genuinely lost my mind trying to count how many times I've been in these places. I'm starting to lose myself, my mind is fracturing.. It's as if, what he's saying is true. Maybe, he's right, but I can't tell.. For these reasons, I beg to be placed anywhere else.\""

twrhimmler.5.t:0 "A Future For the Reich"
twrhimmler.5.d:0 "The future of the German people is on a thin line. The administration must distinguish itself from the failures of the old, ushering the nation into a new chapter of history.\n\nThis process is not only a mere changing of name or flag, it is a change to the national character as a whole, as this phase symbolizes the dawn of a new beginning for the Aryan race."

twrhimmler.6.t:0 "Thought Crimes"
twrhimmler.6.d:0 "The mental capabilities of a singular ordinary citizen are much weaker, and much more vulnerable, than the collective minds of Aryan brotherhoods. In the fight to destroy our Reich, they will be targeting individuals. They will attempt to corrode the mental space, to implant delusions, and to purge us of our Aryan intelligence. If anyone is found to have given over to their false promises, it will have proven a loss of Aryanhood. Never forget, Aryanism can be taken away just as easily as you were born into it.\n\nKnowing the existence of concepts such as their deeds and their beliefs is not a crime, as of the creation of this document. However, on the part of the citizen, it is unjust to think of such concepts without first presenting them in a negative light. "Pragmatic analyzation" as you know it, while in some rare cases it has been proven useful, it is also their greatest instrument of mental degradation. The time is nigh to reconstruct the foundation of one's psyche. Pragmatic analysis tells us to review every piece of something before delivering judgment. Such an ideal is inherently flawed. What if, for example, you were reviewing something, say an idea, and the more you learned about it, the more it could control you. While you analyze it, it analyzes back. If the Schutzstaffel does not cover how to deal with something, that something will come to deal with you. The Schutzstaffel will be taking into its own hands the delivering of punishment for speaking as if the thing one speaks about is not already wrong.\n\nIn the case that you are to think of something, unmentioned by both us and them, you will suppress it. If you do not, before you can even begin to question, they will have twisted your ideas for their own purposes. There is danger in that voice in your head.\n\nWe will never not leave to you our selves."

twrhimmler.7.t:0 "Arisch Mathematik"
twrhimmler.7.d:0 "To be Übermensch is to be naturally imbued with the qualities of ever-expanding wisdom, a powerful and determined inner drive, and an intellect unmatched by any other race inhabiting Jöreth. The Aryan race is adept at the study and expansion of the mathematical field. It is for these reasons that the Reichsführer-SS, Heinrich Himmler, has initiated the official incorporation of the Deutsche Mathematik movement as an organ of the Schutzstaffel. The movement has been relabelled "Arisch Mathematik" in order to be better coordinated with the Second Gleichschaltung, a change made on the personal orders of Heinrich Himmler.\n\nAcclaimed Aryan mathematicians such as Oswald Teichmüller and Ludwig Bieberbach will be heading the committee, and will be given substantial power to reform our nation's educational system. Their work concerning Riemann's surface, habilitation, and holomorphic functions will become necessary reading for scholars entering the mathematical field. Their achievements will be codified across universities throughout Germany, and their progress will forever be known as accomplishments of the Aryan race. They will also be reforming our nation's mathematic outlook, which up until this point has seen little interaction with the Reich itself. The goal of this operation is the establishment of a factually realized connection between the Aryan race and mathematical proficiency, as well as the restructuring of our mathematical community along lines of intuitionist thought.\n\nSuch comprehensive reform plans carry with them many responsibilities. Older mathematicians may attempt to cling to when math was unregulated, and as such, they are obstructing the progression of the Second Gleichschaltung. Teichmüller and Bieberbach themselves have recognized that this field of study has been near-absolutely corrupted by internal Zionists attempting to destroy the Reich from within. Such behavior is to be eradicated.\n\nWe will never not utilize our spatial imaginations."

twrhimmler.8.t:0 "Arische Physik"
twrhimmler.8.d:0 "The concept of the "exploiter and the exploited" has been, throughout history, the foundation of all societies. Hierarchy is primordial, and yet every nation has, until the creation of the Reich, risen and fallen. The reason for this phenomenon is, like in all things, a matter of race. States have made the fatal mistake of letting lower races interbreed with lower castes, leading to the interbreeding of lessers with upper castes, and subsequently leads to demise. Parasites too, such as the Jews, have climbed hierarchies in order to puppet the upper classes and destroy for their benefit. The SS has seen this historical tragedy, and has formed a system to counteract it. The old regimes separated race and hierarchy to their downfall; in reality, the two are the exact same. With such knowledge, it is our destiny to master Jöreth, as well as understand it. The SS requires a true, uncorrupted scientific community to research the laws that govern our world. Being as the Second Gleichschaltung is in progress, the time is nigh for the Aryanization of this Jew-tainted field of study.\n\nAlbert Einstein, a name that haunts the scientific community. The Jew who did nothing but push back progress by presenting abstract connections between space and time, backed by no evidence, and who denied foundational scientific concepts such as the existence of the luminiferous aether. His theories will be eradicated, his existence will be eradicated. Albert Einstein was never a person, just the pen name of internal Zionists, each attempting to destroy the Reich. However, despite these falsities, Jewish Physics necessitates further investigation. We cannot combat them, if we do not understand their capabilities. On the personal orders of Himmler, Werner Heisenberg will be heading research into Jewish Physics.\n\nJohannes Stark, a venerated Aryan physicist and champion of the Arische Physik movement, has been made the head of a committee dedicated to the preservation and revitalization of physics.\n\nWe will never not eradicate the Jewish spirit."

twrhimmler.9.d:0 "A series of research vessels, crashing through the icy waters of the Norwegian Sea, navigate their way towards Svalbard. In the warmer, secured cabins sit researchers and scientists, pouring over maps of Jöreth hollowed out and books such as The Goddess of Atvatabar and Symzonia. In the hulls, facing the brunt of the inhospitable climate are supposed 'Untermenschen,' rescued from execution for a purpose much worse, and much more painful. They are naked, crammed and chained together, and treated as less than subhuman. By landfall, a third were dead or gravely ill, those were thrown out and left to die.\n\nThe sight of Svalbard was magnificent, if not terrifying. Lights of the aurora borealis jumped around the sky, green and purple. The horizon was crowded, taken up by jagged black mountains which penetrated high into the air. The researchers set themselves up in the shadow of a massif, forcing the Untermenschen to construct a circle of wooden cabins in the frigid weather. Despite the climate, the researchers and their SS escorts forced the Untermenschen onto a nearby tundra and began the Great Digging. Given flimsy tools and prisoner outfits, the Untermenschen were told to dig into the Earth and never stop.\n\nQuickly, hypothermia, frostbite, and exhaustion took their toll. The researchers transformed a cabin into barracks, containing nothing, which they hoped would alleviate their problems. It didn't. But, even though the Untermenschen were dying at overwhelming rates, the digging went on. Past the snow, past the soil, into the rocks. They were prepared to sacrifice as many Untermenschen as necessary in order to reach their goal. The SS escorts followed organizational doctrine, beating down anyone who refused to work, dragging them out into the sea, and leaving them to die if they couldn't get back. No matter how much blood was spilt the operation continued.\n\nOnce circumstances proved futile, the researchers and the SS took their belongings and abandoned Svalbard. The Untermenschen were left to die in polar blizzards."

twrhimmler.10.d:0 "There was a fisherman, toiling away, down in the soil to keep starvation away for the day. One day, while collecting water for himself, he sailed down the river.\nHe took the river, and the river took him. Across the forests, and through a land of pillars, reaching far into the sky. It passed overhead a gorge of absolute serenity, before entering the highlands. After days of working against the foaming waters, he reached his peace. The river brought him to a cavern, where he disembarked, and made his way to a valley of blooming peach trees. The people there were unconcerned with the troubles of China, and even though he still had to work to survive, it was his paradise.\n\nSo, this was the 'hellhole,' Corporal Kallweit thought. It would be medieval, if not for the guns of the hunters. He looked upon a desolate village in upper Tibet, locked within the Kunlun Mountains on all sides. It was a perfect location, no one would be able to hear the operation. He looked over to Bruno Beger, the man from the Ahnenerbe. He had been to Tibet previously, in 1939, and so he was the guide. He also had some proven skills which would be necessary for the completion of the operation. Beger's last mission to Tibet had been for a multitude of reasons, from proving Welteislehre, to finding plant material for Lebensraum, to satisfying Himmler's interest in Asian Mysticism. This time around, they had one goal, which they were to complete with efficiency and in secrecy.\n\nHimmler was forming an anthropological museum, for research into racial science, and he needed artifacts. Corporal Kallweit and his men descended the mountain paths, as night began. The village hugged a small lake, and as Kallweit peered over with his binoculars, he felt a strange sensation, he almost felt some semblance of peace. Quickly regaining control of himself, he commenced the operation. Kallweit stayed by the waterside. In the distance, the cracking of rifles and the screaming of families could be heard. Beger walked up behind Kallweit, whispering \"We weren't supposed to use guns. The skeletons will be damaged now.\" Kallweit responded \"If that's the case, we'll be going to another village.\" That addicting tranquility eating him up inside."

The Führer reported to have been hearing voices surrounding his room, and seeing distorted and warped faces in the walls around him, with purely dark hands reaching the very edge of his consciousness, the world around him growing red, his room turning darker and darker as his thoughts edge into his mind. His notebook, one that he kept during his experience to record whatever arcane knowledge he can get, is to put it the best way possible confusing, and the worst way possible gutwrenchingly horrifying. It mostly consisted of cryptic messages and Pagan symbols, with random words of no seeming relations strung in together tightly, and drawings of the black sun, along with hallucinations of dark figures and eyes with their pupils burning.\n\nWhen the physicians performed further examinations, the Reichsführer appears to be in perfect health, and his ramblings about his unearthly experience has ceased, giving the bystanders an illusion.\n\nThe illusion that the Reichsführer has truly recovered."

The man who many had assumed to be the likely successor of the Reichsführer-SS was reported by German authorities to have been assaulted and killed after a private dinner party. Details are sparse but it is generally assumed that after a lengthy dinner party, an unknown assailant entered the estate and surprised him in his chamber. The crime went undetected until the following morning. The assailant having escaped soundlessly into the night.\n\nRumors are already spreading of the nature of the crime, for how could one infiltrate the stronghold of one of the most powerful men in the Reich? Some even speculating that Heinrich Himmler might be involved."

But, this news is not of policies or actions, but rather of a series of government-sponsored outbursts of chaos breaking out across Germany. A second Gleichschaltung has been initiated in order to energize the creation of a unified cultural identity - Aryanism. Youth groups, organized under local SS leadership, have committed massacres, mob lynchings, mutilations, and various other atrocities across cities against supposed dissidents. Regulations for Aryan culture have been introduced, and large-scale crackdowns have begun in the more culturally independent parts of Germany.\n\nLocal economies lie in tatters, German society is only more polarized, and human capital is fleeing en masse."

Heinrich Himmler has formally announced the integration of the Schutzstaffel administration into Greater Germany, in what he terms an 'Ordenstaat' - a new Germanic state dedicated to Himmler's SS alone.\n\nWhat limited freedoms the old order allowed to exist have already been torn down as SS officers take over local governance, and local journalists have been silenced virtually overnight. Only rumors of mass-executions and nightmarishly large internment camps have reached international observers, many of whom are already scrambling to secure their borders against what looks to be the new Black Spot of Europe. After this formation, the areas around the German nation have seen nothing but constant radio silence and the faint rumours of the horrors within. The constant flow of refugees fleeing from the carnage is getting lower and lower as less and less people show up to the Toronto Accord sponsored refugee camps. Whatever may come of this, it's certainly no good."

twrhimmlernews.4.d:0 "The Schutzstaffel has always been a mysterious, esoteric and deeply evil organisation, even by Nazi standards, but even those who knew of its insanity can scarcely believe announcements coming out of Germany. In a bizarre speech, relayed by German newspapers and radio, Heinrich Himmler, leader of the SS, clad not in his usual black SS uniform but an altogether more bizarre, ancient looking outfit, declared the foundation of the Greater Aryan Empire, with himself as its first Emperor. Himmler steps out to his nation, a militaristic and obedient society of mystic Pagans, he calls out for the nation to reclaim its glory, in the foundation and celebration of insanity to its very core.\n\nDespite his totalitarian power, some question whether the rest of the SS can continue to support this seemingly worsening madman. The unadultered insanity of Himmler's dividend has shown its truly terrifying face. The dark continent grows darker as the residents of the 2nd World grow closer and closer into totalitarian madness. The very fabric of reality for millions of Germans is beginning to break, the walls around them starting to melt into disturbing shapes and sizes, resembling...Him."

As of now, it is unclear what the Lammers coup will mean for Germany and the geo-political situation in Europe, but as it is the country's second regime change within the span of a decade, many are having their doubts about the longevity of Nazi power."

While this coup has the secret approval of many officials, Himmler's forces might be able to respond adequately."

Reportedly, Heinrich Himmler 'willingly' announced his immediate resignation and abdication, shortly after, Obergruppenführer Josias assumed the role of Reichsführer-SS and has restored the Greater German Reich.\n\nWhile Josias is a largely unknown figure in the West, it is presumed that his future policies would be focused on abolishing Himmler's previous radical actions."

HSS_Skills_Not_Needed:0 "Skill is an Afterthought"
HSS_Skills_Not_Needed_desc:0 "Due to the recent dissolution of the luftwaffe, we don't have many reliable or trustworthy personel. We may have to lower our requirements for new pilots if wish to make the Waffen-SS air corp a reality."
HSS_Strongest_Will:0 "Strongest Will"
HSS_Strongest_Will_desc:0 "We don't necessarily need that much skill to get by. As long as our inexperienced pilots are sufficiently determined, their strength of spirit will carry them to victory. The ones who survive the coming battles will have accrued the necessary experience to make up for this skill deficiency."
HSS_SS_Helicopter_Brigades:0 "Waffen-SS Helicopter Corp"
HSS_SS_Helicopter_Brigades_desc:0 "Helicopters are a relatively new technology but our engineering advisors suggest they're the future of air combat. One way we could distinguish the SS air corps from the luftwaffe would be to invest heavily in these new-fangled vehicles. The people of Europe will learn to stand in awe (and fear) when they see our black helicopters dotting the skies."
HSS_SS_Paratroopers:0 "Schutzstaffel Fallschirmjäger"
HSS_SS_Paratroopers_desc:0 "The fallschirmjäger were among the most elite and feared members of the luftwaffe of old. We will have to recreate that fearsome reputation if anyone is going to respect our new airforce. The craven untermensch our Europe should live in fear of us, of the possibility of our paratroopers coming down from the heavens to rain fire on them for their insolence."
HSS_Commando_Operations:0 "Commando Operations"
HSS_Commando_Operations_desc:0 "Our advisors suggest that airborne kommandos could be of great tactical use to us if they're employed effectively. Should we drop them into areas of unrest, they may be able to effectively ambush and subdue native undetmenschen and/or Judeo-Bolshevik rebels."
HSS_Late_Night_Raids:0 "Unquestioned Devotion"

HSS_Expand_RSHA:0 "Expanding the RSHA"
HSS_Expand_RSHA_desc:0 "In order to better combat the threat of Zionist subterfuge, the Reich Main Security Office will need more resources and manpower to work with.

We need designated agents of the state who will devote themselves to upholding ideological coherence among the general populace."
HSS_Altering_History:0 "Aryan Cultural Movement"
HSS_Altering_History_desc:0 "The world ought to know that the führer is a man of culture and a patron of the arts. He feels that the glory of the Aryan race should be celebrated through art as well as through words and deeds. We've received his approval to begin work on a series of ambitious cultural projects to facilitate Aryan rejuvenation."
HSS_Paganism_Endorsed:0 "Endorse Paganism"
HSS_Paganism_Endorsed_desc:0 "After discussing the matter at length with the twelfth most elite SS commanders, the führer has elected to go through with one of his boldest decisions to date: a unilateral denunciation of the Christian religion. Christianity has a few interesting ideas but it is irreversibly tainted by its Hebrew origins. The people of Germany deserve a religion that's true to their heritage, Paganism."

HSS_Intergrate_The_High_Command_desc:0 "Integrating the rank-and-file soldiers of the Heer into the Waffen-SS should be pretty simple, but... what to do with the officers corp is a trickier matter.

HSS_The_New_Coronation:0 "The New Coronation"
HSS_The_New_Coronation_desc:0 "The führer has presented us with an even bolder idea than anything we've seen thus far. He wishes to crown himself as the monarch of a new all-German monarchy. A pagan monarchy, old and cryptic by design, but new in its formation and capabilities. Our great and wise monarch will clear our the path for us."
HSS_Rehabilitate_Our_Enemies:0 "Rehabilitate our Enemies"
HSS_Rehabilitate_Our_Enemies_desc:0 "Although many in the SS would've preferred a harsher response, Dr. Lammers is favoring a lenient approach towards the SS's wartime enemies. We've all made mistakes at one point or another, haven't we? Many of them were merely disturbed by Himmler and Heydrich's behavior, so their prior opposition is understandable. He's willing to forgive his former enemies the benefit of the doubt so long as they don't act against him."
HSS_Return_of_the_Wehrmacht:0 "Return of the Wehrmacht"
HSS_Return_of_the_Wehrmacht_desc:0 "There's no need to purge the Heer like Himmler wanted. They were just doing what fighting men are supposed to do: serve their country. We should be cautious about which officers we accept back but the rank-and-file soldiers can and should be accepted back into the fold."
HSS_Sideline_Extreme_Elements:0 "Sideline the Extremists"
HSS_Sideline_Extreme_Elements_desc:0 "The radicals in our ranks have been a persistent thorn in our side throughout the SS's existence. Keeping them around is more trouble than it's worth. They're simply too unhinged to play any part in the Reich's policy-making."
HSS_Restore_the_NSDAP:0 "Restore the NSDAP"

HSS_Status_Quo_With_Schutzstaffel_Bias_desc:0 "The people of the Reich don't want serious change. They want a return to normalcy. We are more than capable of giving them that. From now on the SS will play a larger role in their lives but nothing will fundamentally change."
HSS_Josias_Coup:0 "Josias Coup"
HSS_Josias_Coup_desc:0 "We have tolerated far too much from Himmler and his gang of morbid occultists. Their quasi-pagan sensibilities have gotten too extreme for even the SS's more radical members. The hereditary prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont has taken it upon himself to voice these concerns by intervening to stimmey the excesses of Himmler's disastrous wrath."
HSS_Revert_Himmlers_Reforms:0 "Revert Himmler's Actions"
