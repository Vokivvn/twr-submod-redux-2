 CGR_Secret_Kidnappings_desc:0 "Under orders from the Chancellor, thousands upon thousands of individuals have been added to lists for the eyes of the RSHA. Every person in this list is going to go for a car journey, one they will never return from... if anyone questions these missing peoples, we will simply add another name to the list, and on it will go..."
 CGR_Blackmail_The_Senate:0 "Blackmailing the Senate"
 CGR_Blackmail_The_Senate_desc:0 "Information is king in this new age, and Chancellor Kaltenbrunner has access to it all! The fat, sniveling and crony politicians within the Senate believe themselves invincible. Kaltenbruner intends to remind them who they shall receive their orders from, without question. It will be amusing to watch them grovel and beg before him."
 CGR_SS_Controlled_Police:0 "SS Controlled Police"
 CGR_SS_Controlled_Police_desc:0 "The SS remains the main shield of National Socialism, and our main shield against common crime and division in society are our many police forces. By placing these police units under SS command, they too shall be true servants of National Socialism."
 CGR_Execute_Himmler:0 "Execute Himmler"
 CGR_Execute_Himmler_desc:0 "It has been an open secret that Heinrich Himmler has had designs to transform Germany into his own personal fiefdom for some time now. It has been decided to deal with the chicken farmer sooner rather than later, before he can once again gather his strength and become a very real threat to our national security."
 CGR_Secret_Kidnappings_desc:0 "Under orders from the Chancellor, thousands upon thousands of individuals have been added to lists for the eyes of the RSHA. Every person in this list is going to go for a car journey, one they will never return from...if anyone questions these missing peoples, we will simply add another name to the list, and on it will go..."
 CGR_Unite_The_Agencies_desc:0 "Internal rivalries have been a persistent issue within the Reich, especially in recent years as the old Fuhrer's health declined. The disparity and disunity of the many agencies has also caused many other problems. The Abwher, the SD, the Gestapo, the Kripo, the SiPo, all agencies relating to security must be united under the banner of our new leader!"
 CGR_Matters_Of_State_Security_desc:0 "Enemies are all around us! Our noose around the people has always been a tight one, but clearly not tight enough! We shall tighten and tighten the noose until all thought of dissent and treason are extinguished before they ever appear...and then there shall be peace..."
 CGR_Chancellor_Kaltenbrunner_desc:0 "Ernst Kaltenbrunner, a high ranking member of the SS and the RSHA, has made extreme headway to become chancellor of the Greater Germanic Reich. An ardent anti-semite and wielding massive influence within the Reichs security agencies, many see a darker shadow gathering over Germany. Any thought of genuine reform is dead...maybe for good..."
 CGR_Ensure_Loyalty_From_Army:0 "Ensure Loyalty from the Army"
 CGR_Ensure_Loyalty_From_Army_desc:0 "The Heer has been on edge with the rise of Kaltenbrunner. The Army has never been comfortable with the very existence of the SS, let alone its ascendance, but we can placate many of their fears with a few words from the Chancellor. And any who are seen to be dissident still... they will learn loyalty a different way..."
 CGR_Disband_The_Senate:0 "Disbanding the Senate"
 CGR_Disband_The_Senate_desc:0 "The Senate stinks of the decadence of western Democracy and eastern Bolshevism, trying to rip the National Socialist system apart with petty factionalism from within. The very idea of debating an issue is enemy in nature. When a ruler orders anything, it should simply be done. The Senate's days are numbered."
 CGR_The_New_Reichsfuhrer:0 "The New Reichsführer"
 CGR_The_New_Reichsfuhrer_desc:0 "Every organisation needs a leader, and the SS is no exception. Hummer is gone and a void needs to be filled. The SS needs an uncompromising and tough leader with a heart of steel. Someone like our new Chancellor... now there's a thought..."
 CGR_The_New_Dictator:0 "The New Dictator"
 CGR_The_New_Dictator_desc:0 "One man stands tall in Germany, one man watches over daily life with an iron grip. Ernst Kaltenbrunner is undisputed Fuhrer of the Reich, all those who believed him a middle man and incapable of national leadership have been proven wrong... or they are rotting in the ground..."
 CGR_Cult_Of_Personality:0 "Cult of Personality"
 CGR_Cult_Of_Personality_desc:0 "Adolf Hitler was the key to Germany's success in recent years, and the German peoples love and adoration for him allowed National Socialism to live and breathe. Many however are unaware of who Kaltenbrunner is, therefore all his achievements shall be plastered far and wide. His face is seen by all, always watching, whether from the wall of a building or a flyer distributed to the people."
 CGR_Control_the_Oligarchs:0 "Controlling the Oligarchs"
 CGR_Control_the_Oligarchs_desc:0 "The oligarchs of Germany are a double edged sword. They are key to the running and stability of Germany, but they have considerable power and have interfered in politics on many occasions. The oligarchs need to understand their place, below the Chancellor. Perhaps a few examples will make them fully understand their position. "
 CGR_Finish_The_Task:0 "Finish the Task"
 CGR_Finish_The_Task_desc:0 "The groundwork for the future has been layed. Our children's children shall look back on our work in textbooks not fully understanding the stress, hardship and loss we have faced to make the National Socialist dream a reality. "
 CGR_Chancellor_Seyss-Inquart:0 "Chancellor Seyss-Inquart"
 CGR_Chancellor_Seyss-Inquart_desc:0 "Arthur Seys-Inquart, longtime Reichskommisar of the Netherlands and for a total of three days Chancellor of Austria, has once again become Chancellor. This time however he takes the mantle of Fuhrer of the territories of Germany, Austria and so much more! Perhaps Zes-en-een-kwart, as the Dutch called him, can finally bring peace and stability to Germany..."
 CGR_Rule_With_Experience:0 "Ruling With Experience"
 CGR_Rule_With_Experience_desc:0 "Of all those seeking the chancellorship and title of "Fuhrer" of Germany over the last tumultuous years, none can claim to have served as both a chancellor and Reichskommisar. Fuhrer Seys-Inquart has experience with leadership twice that of any of the false followers of Hitler and their nihilistic ways."
 CGR_Netherlands_As_Example:0 "Netherlands as Example"
 CGR_Netherlands_As_Example_desc:0 "The nation known as the Netherlands or Holland are now a loyal, pacified and integrated part of the Greater Germanic Reich. This can be owed to the work of Seys-Inquart, and the policies used to pacify this region must be now applied to the core of the Fatherland itself, no matter how hard or costly it may be. Those proven to be loyal shall be rewarded. Those who break from the pack and resist will make life difficult for everyone."
 CGR_Hitlers_Austrian_Comrade:0 "Hitler's Austrian Comrade"
 CGR_Hitlers_Austrian_Comrade_desc:0 "The high regard that our dear departed Fuhrer Adolf Hitler held for his old Austrian comrade Arthur Seys-Inquart has been something of public knowledge for some time. Seys-Inquart after all was a key instrument in the fulfillment of the Austrian Anschluss! Now that Seys-Inquart is Fuhrer of Germany, the people know it is the natural succession."
 CGR_The_Austrian_Myth:0 "The Austrian Myth"
 CGR_The_Austrian_Myth_desc:0 "In 1933, a man dubbed the "Bohemian Corporal" became Chancellor of Germany. In time he would become the most famous and influential man of the century. Now another so-called "Bohemian" from Austria has become Chancellor, and with him the glory of the old days will be back."
 CGR_Administrative_Reform:0 "Administrative Reform"
 CGR_Administrative_Reform_desc:0 "Administering an empire is never an easy task, and administering our empire has been a seemingly impossible one. Upon review of our bloated bureaucracy, it seems a miracle the Reich was even functioning at all. Huge swathes of change across our entire administration is needed, or else our Reich risks stagnation it will never recover from."
 CGR_Defender_Of_Germania:0 "Defender of Germania"
 CGR_Defender_Of_Germania_desc:0 "Germania stands as the crowning glory of the Reich. The towering white pillars are proof that we are the new Rome - an Empire that will last a thousand years and beyond! Fuhrer Seys-Inquart will not allow this dream of a bright future to falter. Germania shall be defended to the last, no matter the cost!"
 CGR_Rule_With_Legitimacy:0 "Rule With Legitimacy"
 CGR_Rule_With_Legitimacy_desc:0 "The new Fuhrer of Germany must be seen as a legitimate force to be reckoned with, both internally and abroad! The German people must respect and love their Fuhrer. The American empire and the imperialistic British must see Seys-Inquart for what he is - their superior."
 CGR_Ease_The_Struggle:0 "Easing the Struggle"
 CGR_Ease_The_Struggle_desc:0 "The plight of the last few years has taken its toll on our people, but the fight must go on! The struggle for National Socialism to triumph above all must not be loosened. We must not lose faith and purpose."
 CGR_Dismantle_The_Senate:0 "Dismantle the Senate"
 CGR_Dismantle_The_Senate_desc:0 "The Senate has been of some use to us, but as with any even remotely democratic apparatus, in time it shall grow bolder and more foolish. This shall be nipped in the bud, the Senate shall slowly have its power leached away. Soon they will be incapable of fighting their dismembering, like a crippled beast resisting a gallant hero."
 CGR_Cooperation_With_RKs:0 "Cooperate With the Reichskommissariats"
 CGR_Cooperation_With_RKs_desc:0 "As a former-Reichskommisar himself Seys-Inquart understands the necessity of the near federal system of the Reichskommissariat. The natives of our colonies need the firm hand to allow the destiny of our people's acquiring of Lebensraum to be fulfilled by future generations."
 CGR_Unquestionable_Leadership:0 "Unquestionable Leadership"
 CGR_Unquestionable_Leadership_desc:0 "Loyalty! Loyalty to the Chancellor is at the core of the new regime's aims for Germany. All thought must be how to better the Greater Germanic Reich and its almighty leader! Ernst Kaltenbrunner reigns supreme, and none may challenge him!"
 CGR_Using_A_Scapegoat:0 "Use a Scapegoat"
 CGR_Using_A_Scapegoat_desc:0 "Our fall from grace as a nation is not because of the graceful Germanic peoples, the very thought of that is inconceivable! It is clear that all the separatists and traitors were organised and controlled by the ancient enemy. Even still they breed in the sewers like gutter rats, trying to bring down our glorious Reich. All true servants of the Reich know the name of this enemy...the Jew!"
 CGR_The_Loyal_Oligarchs:0 "The Loyal Oligarchs"
 CGR_The_Loyal_Oligarchs_desc:0 "The oligarchs of Germany are a necessary evil. They are integral to the Reich continued operation but they must be controlled. So long as they are placated they should remain loyal to us and our policies for the Reich."
 CGR_Chancellor_Donitz:0 "Chancellor Dönitz"
 CGR_Chancellor_Donitz_desc:0 "Grand Admiral and Supreme Commander of the Kreigsmarine Karl Donitz has ascended to the mantle of Chancellor of Germany. Some observers are surprised by the ageing admiral's success, especially with other long-time NSDAP officials such as Ribbentrop and Seys-Inquart eyeing the chancellorship. However many within the government know of Donitz's loyalty to the late-Adolf Hitler, unwavering commitment to National Socialism and his hatred for party factionalism."
 CGR_The_Grand_Admiral:0 "The Grand Admiral"
 CGR_The_Grand_Admiral_desc:0 "As Grand Admiral of the Kriegsmarine, Donitz has been instrumental in ensuring the Kriegsmarine becomes one of the most loyal branches of the armed forces to National Socialist ideology. Though the ambitious Plan Z has never been fully implemented due to the many more pressing issues plagueing the Reich, maybe now with a naval man at the helm the Kriegsmarine may receive the attention it needs and deserves."
 CGR_Appeased_Senate:0 "Appease the Senate"
 CGR_Appeased_Senate_desc:0 "The Senate is a complex beast, owing is continued existence to our regime while also seemingly opposing all legislation we attempt to put forward. They also grow bitter over the great powers the Chancellorship still possesses. A means of placating this cage of hungry animals must be found."
 CGR_End_Of_The_Factions:0 "End of Factionalism"
 CGR_End_Of_The_Factions_desc:0 "Division within the NSDAP has been a tiger waiting to break out of a brittle cage for years! Only the charisma and will of Adolf Hitler could keep it at bay and under control. But now Hitler is gone... and factionalism has threatened to break the Reich apart from within. Chancellor Donitz cannot bear to see the Reich destroyed in this manner - the word of Donitz must be law. Those who do not heed his word... they will soon rue that decision..."
 CGR_Unity_Government:0 "Unity Government"
 CGR_Unity_Government_desc:0 "The cooperation of every institute of the German government must be assured if Donitz's aims to cleanse Germany of greed and corruption is to succeed. A government of national unity shall be amassed, containing men whom the Chancellor can rely on and trust, men loyal to the pure ideals of National Socialism and to their new Fuhrer."
 CGR_A_Competent_Chancellor:0 "A Competent Chancellor"
 CGR_A_Competent_Chancellor_desc:0 "The gross misconduct of those who succeeded our glorious Fuhrer Adolf Hitler has almost brought the Reich to its knees. But now a man with an iron will sits at the helm. He is a man who will not compromise and appease the corrupt, decedent and treasonous. That man is Karl Donitz, the man who shall bring competent and efficient rule back to Germania."
 CGR_Cooperate_With_Old_Guards:0 "Cooperate with Old Guard"
 CGR_Cooperate_With_Old_Guards_desc:0 "Disgruntled with the likes of Bormann, Himmler, Goring, Speer, Goebbels, any and all who would stray away from pure National Socialism. With Donitz coming to dominate the Council, hope once again exists that the principles born in blood on the streets of Munich in 1923 still live and breathe. The old guard shall ensure our youths truly understand the sacrifices made for their future."
 CGR_Cramp_Down_On_Corruption:0 "Clamp Down on Corruption"
 CGR_Cramp_Down_On_Corruption_desc:0 "Corruption is rampant throughout our Reich. Reichkommisars treat their domains as personal fiefdoms and money seemingly disappears within the vast bureaucracy. The cogs of the German government engine are barely moving at capacity. It is time to bring about a boost in production."
 CGR_Smooth_Transition:0 "Smooth Transition"
 CGR_Smooth_Transition_desc:0 "The German people must know of our aims of securing the future of the Greater Germanic Reich, and with this knowledge they shall show their gratitude to the Grand Admiral. The public shall be assured that the new leader of Germany seeks to better their lives rather than filling the pockets of oligarchs."
 CGR_Warn_The_Oligarchs:0 "Warn the Oligarchs"
 CGR_Warn_The_Oligarchs_desc:0 "Much of the cancer within Germany can be traced back to the oligarchs who dominate our economy and twist it to their advantage. Those in government have permitted them to carry on operating, both out of fear for their power... but also because they had much to gain personally from working with them. The oligarchs are now dealing with a different kettle of fish in Donitz. And they will have a choice, work with us, follow orders to the letter and survive or continue as they are, and enjoy time as a guest of the Gestapo..."
 CGR_Request_Unlimited_Terms:0 "Request Unlimited Terms"
 CGR_Request_Unlimited_Terms_desc:0 "The death of Adolf Hitler shows that upon the loss of a great leader without an appropriate successor, a nation could face collapse. Donitz must remain at the head of Germania, to assure the survival of the legacy of Adolf Hitler. The Senate and Council shall accept a new amendment, permitting Donitz however many terms he requires to finish his work... or else."
 CGR_Ensured_Rule:0 "Ensured Rulership"
 CGR_Ensured_Rule_desc:0 "Our work to fight corruption and division within the NSDAP is providing results, the government machine is starting to operate optimally once again. Donitz can finally do what no Chancellor has been able to do since Hitler - lead the nation forward!"
 CGR_Crisis_Averted:0 "Crisis Averted"
 CGR_Crisis_Averted_desc:0 "After many tireless nights, Karl Donitz can declare victory. The Reich so many young men died for has been saved, and National Socialism has not needed to be perverted in this process. The crisis is over, now is the time to grow and develop as a proud, Aryan nation."
 CGR_Chancellor_Ribbentrop:0 "Chancellor Ribbentrop"
 CGR_Chancellor_Ribbentrop_desc:0 "Reichsminister of Foreign Affairs Joachim Von Ribbentrop can clink his glass of wine tonight for he has triumphantly assumed the Chancellorship of the Greater Germanic Reich. Ribbenstrops influence in the creation of the German order in Europe is undeniable, and he preaches a position of reestablishing this dominance. Known for not being the most diplomatic diplomat, Ribbentrop has made many enemies over the years. But now everyone seems to want to be Ribbenstrops "friend"..."
 CGR_Pardon_Himmler:0 "Pardon Himmler"
 CGR_Pardon_Himmler_desc:0 "The "Faithful Heinrich" as the Fuhrer used to call him has been the topic of much debate on the Council. Even now some claim the very fact he is still breathing makes him a continued threat. However Ribbentrop knows people, and he knows useful people. Himmler still commands the loyalty of much of the SS, perhaps a pardon will be appreciated...so long as he understands his place."
 CGR_Germany_On_The_Stage:0 "Germany on World Stage"
 CGR_Germany_On_The_Stage_desc:0 "The reestablishment of law and order in Europe is just the first step in Chancellor Ribbentrop's ambitious programme for Germany. Our place on the world stage must once again be that of the primary world power. The United States and the British Empire must be made to know the Reich is second to none. And of the Russian warlord kingdoms to the east they shall be kept in the feudal mess they belong in."
 CGR_A_European_Confederation:0 "European Confederation"
 CGR_A_European_Confederation_desc:0 "Chancellor Ribbentrop's most ambitious project is that of the "Confederation". The aim is a simple one, the unification of Europe's economic and industrial power base into a shared venture dominated by Germany. In the long term the Confederation seeks to unite Europe against the machinations of Bolshevik upstarts and the Imperialistic west. Its execution however, will be no simple matter..."
 CGR_Showcase_Germans_Glory:0 "Showcase Germania Glory"
 CGR_Showcase_Germans_Glory_desc:0 "Germania is the most beautiful, sophisticated and eloquent city in the world! The power of pomp and ceremony is one we used to our full advantage in our formative years, now we shall use it again. But this shall be our grandest affair of them all. The glory of Germany, its people, its army and its leader shall be on display for not only Europe, but for the whole world to see!"
 CGR_European_Unity:0 "European Unity"
 CGR_European_Unity_desc:0 "Not since the days of Napoleon has Europe had one shared destiny! But it is once again a reality, this time under the leadership of Germany and its Fuhrer! Ribbentrop however intends to see to it that the new European order is a permanent one."
 CGR_European_Corp:0 "European Corps"
 CGR_European_Corp_desc:0 "With the Berlin Accords signed and the Confederation a reality at last, the Reich must see to it that our new formal allies do not turn their backs on us and Europe's shared destiny. It only takes one crack to sink a ship, and the European Corps will seal these cracks before they even dare show themselves."
 CGR_We_Need_An_Enemy:0 "We Need An Enemy"
 CGR_We_Need_An_Enemy_desc:0 "Is it not true that our glory days were when our people had an opponent, an aim to aspire to and a goliath to topple. Though beaten and badly dismembered, the Bolshevik enemy still continues to breathe weezy breathes of pathetic life. So long as they exist they are a threat to Lebensraum! Time to give the people a true enemy once again."
 CGR_Satisfying_The_Military_Complex:0 "Satisfying the Military Complex"
 CGR_Satisfying_The_Military_Complex_desc:0 "Satisfying the military is crucial if we wish to remain in power. The army has wanted a foreign war for years, it's no secret they do not enjoy the role of policemen and peacekeepers. Since the end of hostilities in the 1940s the military have been pining for a new enemy... or in this case an old enemy once more resurgent."
 CGR_Top_Of_The_Castle:0 "On Top of the Castle"
 CGR_Top_Of_The_Castle_desc:0 "The reigns of power are secure, the Army and the SS's loyalty assured and our wallets grow thicker and thicker. Joachim Von Ribbentrop was a man very few could have seen as being the head of Germany not too long ago, but now that illusion is shattered. Ribbentrop stands tall in his castle, looking over the battlements satisfied and content at his work. All others are there to serve him, and him alone..."
 CGR_Secret_Deals_With_Army:0 "Secret Deals with the Heer"
 CGR_Secret_Deals_With_Army_desc:0 "The relationship between the Heer and the NSDAP has been a rocky one for most of Third Reich's history. The Heer remains dominated by stiff-backed Prussians who do not even permit the National Socialist salute as a mandatory custom. But they share our aims of European domination, maybe a deal can be reached securing their loyalty... for a price."
 CGR_Tool_of_the_Oligarchs:0 "Tool of the Oligarchs"
 CGR_Tool_of_the_Oligarchs_desc:0 "Oligarchs have become extremely powerful within the Reich, to the point that many government ministries follow their orders more than ours. The power of these men cannot be ignored, but they have reassured the Chancellor that so long as he does not interfere in their business...he shall receive many lucrative rewards..."
 CGR_Handling_Oppositions:0 "Handling the Oppositions"
 CGR_Handling_Oppositions_desc:0 "Opposition, both within the party and outside it, still persists within our Reich. This is unacceptable! How can the Reich ever progress if these men and women continue to impede our efforts!?! We shall instill in these people a fear they have never felt before that they won't dare step foot outside their homes!"
 CGR_Profits_Of_Corruption:0 "Benefits of Corruption"
 CGR_Profits_Of_Corruption_desc:0 "Corruption has always been a dirty word, and something many a naive politician has sought to eradicate. Nine out of ten of these politicians soon learn an important lesson: those in power should be permitted to occasionally enjoy the finer things in life, it is their prerogative after all."
 CGR_Help_From_The_SS:0 "Help from the SS"
 CGR_Help_From_The_SS_desc:0 "The significance of the work of the SS and its many branches in the defence and success of National Socialism cannot be overstated, however over the years certain elements have become more dissident in nature. Most of these dissidents have now been dealt with, and with Himmler swearing loyalty to our new government many within the SS have followed suit. They shall prove very useful in our good work to come."
 CGR_The_Ruthless_Tyrant:0 "The Ruthless Tyrant"
 CGR_The_Ruthless_Tyrant_desc:0 "Germany's new leader has never been one for niceties and the quid pro-quo of diplomacy. Instead Ribbentrop favours a heavy handed and direct approach. Dissent and treasonous thought are unacceptable, in all walks of life! Many over the years have shunned Ribbentrop, but now those fools shall get just what they deserve!"

 CGR_About_The_Bomb:0 "The Bomb"

 CGR_Float_The_Marks:0 "Floating the Reichsmark"
 CGR_Float_The_Marks_desc:0 "If we want to establish ourselves as the new, legitimate, government of Germany, we need to establish a stable currency that will support a strong economy, to provide for the Ayran Race.

 CGR_Control_The_Market:0 "Controlling the Market"
 CGR_Control_The_Market_desc:0 "If we intend to recover properly from the Civil War we must control the economy so we can maximize production of military and governmental products.

 CGR_Play_The_Waiting_Game:0 "Play the Waiting Game"
 CGR_Play_The_Waiting_Game_desc:0 "If we want to let the economy permanently recover, we need to let the Aryan economy sort itself out. If we act too speedy in our recovery and provide too much welfare we might end up making our economy dependent on too many public projects. Fortunately for us we have a large market and strong industry that will naturally reopen as we get further away from the end of the Civil War."
 CGR_Try_To_Meddle:0 "Quick Results"
 CGR_Try_To_Meddle_desc:0 "Now that the Civil War has ended, we need to take quick action to recover our economy, otherwise the Toronto Accord might strike while we are still weak. A series of government intervention programs and public works will help speed up the recovery."
 CGR_In_The_Meantime:0 "Let the Economy Develop"

 twrcouncilgermany.1.t:0 "Total Economic Collapse"
 twrcouncilgermany.1.d:0 "Despite the swift recovery following the German civil war, the total end of reliable colonial revenue, and thus hundreds of billions in Reichsmark used to develop the newly acquired Lebensraum meant that our economy was still a shadow of what it was under Hitler's tenure. The Toronto Accord lifting most sanctions did little to mend that, quality of life decreasing rapidly and unrest spreading.\n\nOur \"third way\" reform package aimed at restoring quality of life to pre-civil war standard as well as building up the economy now has failed. With inflation rising through the roof and bringing back memories of the old Weimar Republic and trade with other nations having all but ceased.\n\nIt will take tremendous efforts and political prowess to not only stir the ship clear of the economic devastation but also keep Germany politically stable."
 twrcouncilgermany.1.a:0 "Is history bound to repeat itself?"
 twrcouncilgermany.2.t:0 "The Economic Recovery"
 twrcouncilgermany.2.d:0 "We have stirred the ship clear, history luckily did not repeat itself and we did not fall into the maelstrom of violence and hopelessness as the Weimar Republic did. Whilst Germany will perhaps take decades to compete with the Toronto Accord again economically, the German populace once more enjoys the same prosperity it did before the civil war.\n\nMore effort will have to be committed as to securing German prosperity in the future whilst maintaining a balanced military budget as the ghosts we called in eastern europe and beyond may come back to haunt us but for now at least peace and prosperity reigns once more in Germany."
 twrcouncilgermany.2.a:0 "Let's just hope no more war is on the horizon."
 twrcouncilgermany.3.t:0 "Supernova of the Black Sun"
 twrcouncilgermany.3.d:0 "The wind blew in a cacophonic pandemonium of flurries and squalls. All the lights were blaring, shining across and throughout the Reich. It was an hour of profound human change, and excitement was generating in the air.\n\nA band of SS men, loyal to Kaltenbrunner, brought forth their luggage. They were bloodied, and exhausted by their march. Heinrich Himmler, pushed into the courtyard by the end of rifles, knelt on the ground as if a parasite exhumed. His expression was one of hate, and only hate. He sat there, glaring at everyone around him with an intense loathing, waiting for them to wither. Himmler, looking as though a seething homunculus, was left to bake in his utter revulsion and resentment until he was brought forth to the courtyard's walls. Some recording equipment was fetched to document such a monumental step towards the progression of mankind. Kaltenbrunner gave a speech, slowly listing off the countless crimes against humanity committed by the man before them.\n\nA tempest came upon the courtyard. Their vision was overtaken by whirling masses of rain, spraying against every surface in the open. Despite the gales blowing against him, Kaltenbrunner continued his speech, and continued giving it with the gravity it deserved. Once finished, a circle of SS men surrounded Himmler and pointed forward their guns. While waiting for Kaltenbrunner to give the order, all that could be heard was the wind and Himmler's own heavy breathing. Kaltenbrunner shouted something indiscernible, but no matter, the deed was done. A cascade of lead hit Himmler from every side, and it didn't stop. Even though he was long dead, the men kept shooting at Himmler's corpse for minutes. All that was left on the courtroom wall was blood and guts.\n\nThe scene was overtaken by a deafening silence. What remained of his corpse was left to sink away in the rains. Kaltenbrunner and his men left the scene without joy nor sadness. Their honor was no loyalty."
 twrcouncilgermany.3.a:0 "In the meantime, in between time."
 twrcouncilgermany.4.t:0 "The New Reichsführer"
 twrcouncilgermany.4.d:0 "Ernst Kaltenbrunner is many things: a relative outsider even after decades of proximity to the halls of power in Germania, a committed National Socialist, and a man with a tight grip on the security apparatus whose tendrils spread through the nation like a clinging vine. He is not, however, a coward. In the wake of Himmler's death, he does not fight the accusations that he is an usurper, an interloper. He embraces it, calling himself the logical solution to the problems that plagued Councilist Germany - and a scourge to all who would call themselves its enemies.\n\nAlready the fetters have begun to fall around the Fuhrer's hands, and with them fall the heads of hundreds who will become the administration's first victims in a coordinated national purge. Former SS heads are dragged from homes and liquidated, policemen and generals alike are dragged through the streets and then shot in town squares, and Senators beg like dogs for their lives in the face of the gauntlets of the Special Methods Divisions.\n\nThe Council itself falls away, first in fact and then in rhetoric, and with its demise all that is left is power, power naked, savage, and unsparing. And Ernst Kaltenbrunner, outsider, usurper, Reichsführer, stands at its head, leading the wolfpack ever onwards - who knows who, or what, will be next in his sights?"

 twrcouncilgermany.5.t:0 "The Austrian Myth"
 twrcouncilgermany.5.d:0 "There is a saying that for every generation of Germans there are two people: one in Berlin to lead the nation, and one born in Austria to save it from the Berliner. It is no coincidence that this saying has come into vogue once again, as the collapse of Germany and its subsequent rise from the ashes has thrust a very different group of people into the helms of national leadership - and as the unassuming Arthur Seyss-Inquart rises in turn to the head of this group, the rumors rise and rise around him like a hot summer breeze.\n\nSoon propagandists for the Council have spread it all over Germany, flooding out other incipient personality cults of other members as they do so. People begin to whisper on shelled-out street-corners that perhaps Seyss-Inquart has taken on the mantle of authority - that Hitler has come again, in a very different form and time, to save Germany from itself as in the time of Weimar. And now, more than ever, Germany needs a savior. Perhaps, it is whispered, lightning has struck twice. So it is that the processions begin, carrying the image of the possum-faced governor high above the streets in waves of human celebration that reach the Reichstag itself.\n\nWhen the final announcement comes, it is more of a denouement than a climax - Seyss-Inquart has been appointed Chancellor of Germany by popular decree and national desperation. It is to be hoped that he will be as successful an Austrian as the last one who came - and, left unsaid, more capable of avoiding mistakes."

 twrcouncilgermany.6.t:0 "An Invitation to the European Confederation"
 twrcouncilgermany.6.d:0 "The memorandum from the new Germany is surprisingly succinct. Chancellor Von Ribbentrop has enforced strict limits on the famously verbose German foreign service, according to our diplomatic circles. Even if he had not, the contents of the letter would still have left us reeling - for what the new leader proposes is something entirely new to European politics.\n\nThe basics are simple: a treaty, to be ratified in Germania itself, binding the currencies and resource markets of German allies in a single economic sphere. The Confederation, as it is being termed, will focus its initial programme on coal and steel production and industrial infrastructure - as Germany's slow rebuilding intensifies, the programme will quite literally pay for itself in economic dividends. Economic advisors are also advocating for a broad swathe of military production to be diversified within the members of the sphere, citing reduced production timing and resource burdens on domestic markets.\n\nThat is not the end of the matter, as far as Ribbentrop is concerned. He has far greater plans for the future than a simple economic agreement - and as our diplomatic advisors make clear, Germany is quite willing to pull its European friends into the future in spite of their protests. He has in mind nothing less than a pan-European alliance, a ring of iron protecting the Continent from the depredations of foreign powers. But that is for the future. For now, all that is necessary is a choice.\n\nAre we with them or against them?"

Reports are still flowing in of the sheer magnitude of many of the showcased works, some of which were commissioned for the express purpose of the Expo. The Reich has refused to comment on widespread accusations of exploitative treatment of workers, particularly female entertainers, at the event.\n\nObservers also reported special-access guests with personal relationships to Von Ribbentrop himself being given a tour of the innermost workings of the Reichstag and its environs, with artworks long thought lost with Göring's personal collection appearing in isolated photos after the tour."

Delegates from across Europe's authoritarian and National Socialist territories have assembled in Germania and ratified what they are calling the Berlin Accords, a common economic bloc dedicated to the \"peace and commonwealth\" of Europe's peoples. Reduced tariffs on key commodities, industrial collaboration and development projects will define European financial markets for decades to come.\n\nToronto Accord observers have already denounced the fledgeling bloc as a clear sign of unhinged geopolitical ambition and have vowed to monitor the recovering Germany for signs of combined military activity. Regardless of their suspicions, it is clear that the German Fuhrer has redefined European politics with the stroke of a pen - and that this legacy seems likely to outlive his passing."
