 agrarianism:0 "Agrarianism"
 agrarianism_desc:0 "§YAgrarianism§! is a political and social philosophy that promotes subsistence agriculture, smallholdings, egalitarianism, with agrarian political parties normally supporting the rights and sustainability of small farmers and poor peasants against the wealthy in society. In highly developed and industrial nations or regions it can denote use of financial and social incentives for self-sustainability, more community involvement in food production (such as allotment gardens) and smart growth that avoids urban sprawl."

 ustasa_movement:0 "Ustaša Movement"
 ustasa_movement_desc:0 "§YUstaša Movement§! (Also sometimes refered to as Ustašism) is the ideology of the UHRO ( Ustaša - Croatian Revolutionary Organization). The ideology of the movement is a blend of fascism, Roman Catholicism and extreme Croatian nationalism. The Ustaše support the creation of a Greater Croatia that would span the Drina River and extend to the border of Belgrade. The movement views Croats as not slavs, but of gothic origin, only tained with the slavic language; it also emphasizes the need for a racially "pure" Croatia and promotes ethnic cleansing of other minorities, but it views the Bosniaks as "Muslim Croats", and as a result, Bosniaks are not persecuted on the basis of race. The ideology uses the system of planned economy, the so-called "Croatian Socialism", an attempt to create a non-marxist socialist system."

 ## Leader Descriptions ##
 #########################
 ANTE_PAVELIC_DESC:0 "Every nation has its national hero. For the Americans, it is Washington. For the Germans, Hitler. But many agree that there are few national heroes less deserving of such a title than Ante Pavelic, Poglavnik of Croatia. Along with national hero, he has found himself with many more, less flattering titles; among them terrorist, murderer, war criminal, and butcher. And, unlike "hero", each of these is true. Pavelic has led a regime of unmatched brutality, save for perhaps Germany's Eastern European territories. The Ustashe has engaged in a horrific campaign of cleansing and expelling Serbs, Jews, and Romani from Croatia, the brutality of which Heinrich Himmler allegedly had called "ridiculous".\n\nWith the tendrils of the Ustashe going from Zagreb to Dubrovnik, it seems that there will be no end to Croatia's woes. Every day, opponents of the regime, Jews, and Serbs are executed with methods often primitive and brutal. Pavelic's rule seems endless, with the partisans being hunted to the nation's borderlands and across the border. As Pavelic turns Croatia to feast upon her neighbours, the world wonders how long his shop of horrors can last."
 ANDRIJA_ARTUKOVIC_DESC:0 "For years, many considered Ante Pavelić's government to be a rogue state run by butchers. None of it would've been possible without his trusty deputy that now leads Croatia; Andrija Artuković. An early follower of the Ustaše and one of the late Poglavnik's closest ministers, Andrija had been instrumental in consolidating fascist rule in Croatia and with it the enforcement of the state's draconian racial and security laws. A fervent antisemite, he was tasked with pursuing a "Solution to the Jewish question", a job that he has undertaken with ruthless efficiency over the years. Now in charge of the Independent State of Croatia following the Poglavnik's unexpected death, Croatia's "Architect Of Terror" has brought the Jewel Of The Adriatic further into darkness as he works to fulfill Pavelić's legacy in the face of staunch opposition in Rome and Belgrade."
 MLADEN_LORKOVIC_DESC:0 "A short, unassuming man, Mladen Lorković was born in 1909 to prominent Croatian nationalist politicians. Joining the fledgling Ustaše movement early on, he quickly became a senior member within Pavelić's inner circle. Invited to join the Independent State of Croatia as a high ranking cabinet member, Mladen was made Minister of Foreign Affairs, securing diplomatic ties with allies of Nazi Germany's new European order. His time watching the European order stagnate and crumble following the death of Adolf Hitler made Lorković quickly become disillusioned with Ante Pavelić and the Ustaše as a whole, fearing that the same chain of events in Germany would happen to his nation; A fear that would come to fruition after Pavelić died. Seizing his opportunity in usurping Pavelić's successorship in the midst of all the chaos, Mladen destroyed the regime from inside and declared a coalition government with the formerly-ostracized Croatian Peasant's Party in the hopes of reshaping Croatia in the image of a modern fascist state as opposed to the old ideas of a clandestine terrorist organization in control of an entire nation-state."
 MLADEN_LORKOVIC_U_DESC:0 "A short, unassuming man, Mladen Lorković was born in 1909 to prominent Croatian nationalist politicians. Joining the fledgling Ustaše movement early on, he quickly became a senior member within Pavelić's inner circle. Invited to join the Independent State of Croatia as a high ranking cabinet member, Mladen was made Minister of Foreign Affairs, securing diplomatic ties with allies of Nazi Germany's new European order. His time watching the European order stagnate and crumble following the death of Adolf Hitler made Lorković quickly become disillusioned with Ante Pavelić and the Ustaše as a whole, fearing that the same chain of events in Germany would happen to his nation; A fear that would come to fruition after Pavelić died. Seizing his opportunity in usurping Pavelić's successorship in the midst of all the chaos, Mladen now has to carefully steer the country in his direction."
 AUGUST_KOSUTIC_DESC:0 "August Košutić is someone that many consider to have been born to be a politician, a man who grew up surrounded by politicians and was invariably influenced by them. Born to HSS commissioners in 1893, young August had been baptized by HSS leader and Croatian nationalist Stjepan Radić and would prove to be an incredibly intelligent child. Spending much of his childhood reading the collective works of his ostracized godfather and mentor, he eventually married Radić’s daughter and became a highly influential Croatian politician within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.  Having been alienated by the Yugoslavian royal dictatorship, he reluctantly sided with the Ustaše when the Independent State of Croatia was proclaimed, he had quickly found himself nothing more than a pawn for Ante Pavelić’s totalitarian grip on Croatia while going in and out of his prisons. Taking the leadership of the HSS after Maček’s death in Jasenovac,  Košutić would begin plotting behind closed doors with representatives of the Croatian Home Guard in the hopes of deposing the Ustaše altogether. Now finally the first democratic president of Croatia,  Košutić will work tirelessly to fulfill the legacies of his late mentors."
 TOMISLAV_II_DESC:0 "Considered a foreigner in his own kingdom, King Tomislav II was born Duke Aimone of Aosta-Savoy in 1900 and enrolled in the Italian naval academy, becoming well known for leading mountain climbing expeditions in Nepal. Having been initially promised and later denied the crown of Croatia following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941, he had waited impatiently in Rome for his opportunity to arise, slowly learning the Croatian language and its people's customs so that he may one day be seen as their king. Now finally the King of Croatia in what many see as nothing more than an Italian colony, His Majesty still has a long way to go before his government will be considered legitimate by both foreign powers and the Croatian people."
 KARLO_MRAZOVIC_DESC:0 "Born in Mursko Središće, on October the 26th 1902, Karlo Mrazović is a Veteran Communist, having took part in 1919 in the defense of the hungarian soviet republic, In 1927 he became member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. After attending the Communist university in Moscow he fought in the international brigades in spain in 1936, only to be severly wounded a year later. In Zagreb in 1939, he was captured and taken to the Prison Lepoglava, only to be realesed in spring 1940. During the European war, he was one of the organizers of the armed uprising in Slavonia in 1941, commander of the First Slavonian Partisan Detachment, a member of the General Staff of the Croatian National Liberation Army and other. He was elected a councilor of AVNOJ and was a member of the Presidency of ZAVNOH. Now that the Socialist Regime has took over Croatia, he will give everything he can to better the lives of not just Croats, but every person who lives in the country."

Later that year he was appointed Director of Train Services in Sarajevo. He was an organising commander of all Ustaša traffic brigades. An associate of Jure Francetić, he was a founding member of Crna Legija (Black Legion). In 1943 he left Sarajevo and moved to Zagreb and on 11 October of that year he was appointed Minister of Traffic.At the suggestion of Mladen Lorković, he was promoted to the Ustaše rank of colonel and named minister of the Armed Forces on 29 January 1944, without the approval of German ambassador Siegfried Kasche and German military attache Edmund Glaise von Horstenau. On 13 July 1944 Ante Pavelić promoted him to the highest rank, that of Krilnik (Brigadier General). He became a close associate and friend of Mladen Lorković. Lorković introduced him to Baroness Vraniczany and Baroness Zlata Lubienski, members of high society, who became his good friends. At the beginning of August 1944, he stood as best man at the marriage of Lorković. With the instability in the nation seeming endless, Vokić led a coup against the government and succeded, now at the head of the new state, he needs to decide in which way to steer the young country."

During his search for a job at an early age, he toured Czechoslovakia where he stayed for a short time at Skoda Works, then later moved to Berlin and finally returned to Austria-Hungary where he worked until his conscription into the Austro-Hungarian army. At the outbreak of the First World War, he was transferred to the Serbian front, but after unsuccessful invasions, in 1915 he was transferred to Galicia where he fought against the Russians, only to be captured and transferred to the Urals iin a labour camp. Having been released during the Russian Revolution, he returned to Yugoslavia in 1918, and soon joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. Originally a propaganda minister, he soon became its commissioner in 1937, and eventually party president in 1939.\n\nAfter the war broke out, his troops retreated to the forests in what became known as the partisan movement.\n\nJosip Broz 'Tito' has now become the unquestionable ruler of Yugoslavia, the future of the Balkans remains uncertain as ever."

 Franjo_Gazi_DESC:0 "Much could be said about Franjo Gaži, an agronomist and translator, Franjo worked in the Department of Agruculture of the Banovina of Croatia before becoming a Yugoslav trade attaché in Moscow. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Gaži moved to Jerusalem, Istanbul, Cairo and London where he worked with the Allies to secure economic aid for Yugoslavia. After the war, he was appointed a delegate to the third session of the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia on behalf of the Croatian Peasant Party.

Geneva, Krnjević edited and printed "Croatia", a multi-lingual newsletter reporting on Yugoslavia's brutal police regime. Longer travels in 1935 and 1938 took Krnjević to Canada and the US, where many Croatian emigrants were strong supporters of the HSS. Having been nominated to the Senate, Krnjević was now able to return from Geneva, just as war broke out in Poland. Now in control of Banovina of Croatia, things seemed to be going well, until the German Invasion of Yugoslavia and the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia and the Soviet Collapse, things seemed dark for the croat people, but with the help of the homeguard, the ustashe have been overthrown and hss has won the first croatian democratic elections in recent history. Now with him as the president as a de-ustašefied Croatia, he seeks to follow the Agrarianist line, his Predecessor's imagined."
 Vladimir_Bakaric_DESC:0 "Like many partisans, Bakarić is a veteran communist, having helped to organise the partisan resistance in the Independent State of Croatia. A close collaborator of Josip Broz , he wishes to help him reunite Yugoslavia in a socialist image. He also belongs to a more liberal wing of the party, which can quite frequently result in clashes and disagreements in the party meetings between his side and the hardliners."

 BOZIDAR_KAVRAN_DESC:0 "Božidar Kavran was born in Zagreb. Since 1935, he has been active in the cultural and academic society "August Šenoa", the most famous Croatian student nationalist society in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. He graduated in pharmacy in 1939. Immediately after the establishment of the NDH, Kavran was entrusted with responsible duties. In May 1943, Ante Pavelić appointed him the administrative commander of all Ustaša and deputy lineman for all Ustaša organizations. In these positions, he managed the activities of the Ustaša organizations of the NDH. After the fall of the NDH he tried to stage an uprising called "Action of April the 10th". Now at the helm of Croatia, he seeks to finally establish a pure Croatia, rid of any foreign and domestic opposition, by any means necessary."


 Crazy_Hamburger_Desc:0 "A mysterious figure in the beating heart of Bosnia, Joker Omčo is nonetheless a wanted criminal by the Ustase on crimes of civil disturbance and murder. A skilled chef, Omčo's village frequently describes him as a man known for having a hearty laugh and an insatiable appetite. His special dish, the "Crazy Hamburger" is a delicacy amongst the Bosnian people, including a variety of dishes from around the world. Cheese from Brazil, Bread from Turkey, oil from Iraq, horse meat, grass of death, red hot chili peppers and cooked on a thousand degrees, the "Crazy Hamburger" is something that the Croatian government (and perhaps the world as a whole) fears not out of disgust, but out of ignorance. Now in control of Bosnia, Omčo and his "horrible horrible spicy crazy Joker hamburger" shall encompass Bosnia and the entire Balkans in an orgy of madness and culinary professionalism."

 twrcroatia.1.t:0 "Night"
 twrcroatia.1.d:0 "For the people of Croatia, there is no longer such a thing as day. The sun no longer shines its bright rays, nor do the Croatians breathe freely. Though the time continues, and life goes on, it is not the same as it is elsewhere in the world. In Croatia, it is as if a terrible, endless night has been cast down onto these lands, forever cursing its people to an eternity of damnation.\n\nUnder the nearly decade-long rule of the Ustashe, there has been irrevocable change. Though there have long been ethnic conflicts between the Croats and the Serbs, the Ustashe has committed crimes of unspeakable scale. Many have fled eastwards, for Serbia, or northwards to Hungary. Countless more are not so fortunate to escape. The Jewish people, as well, have faced brutal crimes against them, their blood being the rain of the Croatian springtime - and their ashes the snow of the Croatian winter.\n\nThe partisans have been almost forced out of Croatia, mainly setting up bases of operations in the region of Kvarner, others have retreated to Serbia and the mountains of eastern Bosnia. The Chetniks are holding out in the city of Visegrad, isolated and with little in terms of food or supply. There is nothing in Croatia, save for Ante Pavelic's Ustase. The sun no longer shines upon Croatia. There is nothing but the dark night, never to end."
 twrcroatia.1.a:0 "I heard the beast say, come and see. And I beheld."

 twrcroatia.2.t:0 "The Zagreb Uprising"
 twrcroatia.2.d:0 "This morning began as another day in Zagreb. A bubble of peace, isolated from the violence and chaos of the rest of Croatia. Where there were no camps, nor Ustashe soldiers hunting down Jews and Serbs. It was as peaceful as one could have it under the Ustashe.\n\nThe bubble of peace, however, was suddenly punctured by a car speeding towards the Poglavnik's palace. As it rammed through the gates, an explosion shook the earth, as the gate had been destroyed by a suicide bomber. Quickly, multiple partisans filed through, onto the palace grounds. Overpowering the guards, they went to find Ante Pavelic. The Poglavnik armed himself, and, along with his bodyguards, barricaded the stairwell, to keep the partisans at bay. A battle ended in the partisans coming up the stairs, only to see him jump from his window to the ground a story below.\n\nAs Pavelic hit the pavement, bleeding profusely and with broken legs from what he had endured, he found himself surrounded by partisans. His death would be short, with him not even managing to beg for mercy before he was filled with bullets. The partisans draped the flag of Yugoslavia down from the windows, chanting, "brotherhood and unity."\n\nThe Ustashe would not let this go on. Tank and bomber units were dispatched to quell the partisans. Zagreb was in a state of war unseen in nearly a decade. Though all partisans involved were killed, and Andrija Artukovic was declared Poglavnik that night, a message had been sent to the Croatian people that the Ustashe was not forever. Several riots have already broken out across the country, most prominently in Bosnian cities such as Sarajevo, Vishegrad, and Banja Luka."
 twrcroatia.2.a:0 "Croatia burns."
 
 twrcroatia.3.t:0 "A Midnight Putsch"
 twrcroatia.3.d:0 "It was pitch black outside. Zagreb had been suffering from widespread power outages since the insurgency began, but even as the dust settled it seemed as if Croatia had finally reverted back to the Dark Ages. The tranquil night sky was suddenly interrupted by a barrage of gunfire within the Croatian parliament as unidentified members of the Home Guard stormed the building with one goal in mind; coup d'etat. As room-to-room fighting quickly turned the typically dull building into a war zone, a small group of soldierss and the Putsch's leader finally made it to the Poglavnik's office. Busting the door down, they quickly found Andrija Artukovic fubling around his desk trying to grab a gun. "Mladen!" he cried, looking at the man who stood before him. Mladen Lorkovic had long since tired of the late Poglavnik's repeated failures and to him Andrija was more of the same. Although a short, stubby man with no real charisma, Mladen Lorkovic was nonetheless a skilled negotiator that had managed to bring the army on his side in what many would see as High Treason. "I should've known it would've been a rat like you!" Artukovic yelled, his trembling hand grabbing his gun and pointing it at Lorkovic. "You've made a grave mistake here Mladen... But i sure as hell won't give you anything to gloat over." He said, quickly putting the gun in his mouth and pulling the trigger."
 twrcroatia.3.a:0 "The sun rises on a new Croatia."
 
 twrcroatia.4.t:0 "Executions in Zagreb"
 twrcroatia.4.d:0 ""And today, we have... Ivan Simunic." The commissar read aloud, clearly uninterested. The prison's courtyard was deserted by this point as all of its inmates had recently perished. The two prison guards opened a door and shoved their last prisoner out onto the grass. He was barely wearing anything, having been savagely beaten with little time for his blood to actually clot. Coughing with what little energy he had left, Simunic looked up to see the bright sun blind him and the commissar's scowl towering over him. Picking up the prisoner and sitting him down on a single chair, the commissar pulled out his old pistol and put it right to Simunic's head. "You are accused of high treason and conspiracy with communist forces. How do you plead?" Ivan looked at him square in the eye, smiled and spat in his face "Go to hell, fascist piece of shit." he murmured. Wiping the spit off his face, the commissar pulled the pin on his gun and put his finger on the trigger. "Sloboda Narodu." Simunic said, looking straight into the gun's barrel. The commissar pulled the trigger, and Ivan's lifeless body fell to the ground. The chair and surrounding grass were stained with the late partisan's blood as the two guards picked up Ivan's corpse and carried it away."
 twrcroatia.4.a:0 "Resistance is futile."
 
 twrcroatia.5.t:0 "Croatia Requests Military Shipments"
 twrcroatia.5.d:0 "Our former allies in the Independent State of Croatia has requested our help in their latest campaign against the communist partisans that run rife throughout their nation. While their interests undoubtedly align with ours, our high command stresses that giving aid to subhuman Slavs while the Reich teeters on the brink of disaster may weaken Germany further. The decision however, ultimately rests with the Führer and his future plans for the Balkans."
 twrcroatia.5.a:0 "The Poglavnik will have our support."
 twrcroatia.5.b:0 "Who cares about Croatia?"
 
 twrcroatia.6.t:0 "Germany Sends Military Aid"
 twrcroatia.6.d:0 "Good news! Our old friends in Germany have agreed to send us the weapons we so desperately needed."
 twrcroatia.6.a:0 "Excellent."
 
 twrcroatia.7.t:0 "Germany Refuses to Send Aid"
 twrcroatia.7.d:0 "Terrible news! Our former benefactors in Germany have refused to send us the aid we need in continuing our pacification campaign! Citing rising tensions in the Reich as Hitler inches ever-closer to death, it would seem that this time the glorious Fuhrer of Germany has left us on our own for now."
 twrcroatia.7.a:0 "We will go on without them."
 
 twrcroatia.8.t:0 "Village Fire"
 twrcroatia.8.d:0 "The quiet darkness of night descended upon the village. The mothers, fathers, and children all went to bed, their fears dispelled by the light of the moon and the stars. The threat of an Ustashe attack disappeared, to return tomorrow. Yet, if one looked towards the hills, they would see the faint orange glow of the coming fire.\n\nCrossing over the hills into the valley below, the Croatian soldiers laid their eyes upon their target. An idyllic place, untouched by decades of war and terror. But looks would not save this village of Serbs. The soldiers armed themselves with their flamethrowers and out came waves of fire.\n\nPlumes of smoke rose into the air. The darkness was lit up with bright colours of red, orange, yellow and white. Some jumped out their windows to the ground below, the soldiers shooting them where they fell. They barricaded the doors, to make sure that no Serb could escape their punishment - one that had been willed by the Poglavnik, the people, and almighty God.\n\nThat night, as the Crusaders of a modern era departed, they heard the screams of the damned amongst the flames of an earthly Hell, and the village turned from wood to ash."
 twrcroatia.8.a:0 "Out of the heart of man come evil thoughts."
 
 twrcroatia.9.t:0 "Exile"
 twrcroatia.9.d:0 ""Are we there yet?" Mirko asked. They had been on the road for almost three hours now, having been forced to go on foot to wherever may take them. Little Mirko and his only surviving relative, his bigger sister Katarina had been forced from their home, just outside Visegrad, by the new Ustase campaign. Choosing to head east to Serbia, she hoped that maybe their estranged father would be there. "Quiet, rats!" The Black Legion soldier yelled behind them, prodding his still-warm gun into her backside. He was not much older than her, likely a new recruit given his trigger-happy attitude. Walking faster with Mirko in her arms, they continued onto what they hoped would be salvation.\n\nHow were they going to make money? Where were they going to find their papa? Was he even alive? They'd surely figure things out as time went on. Her thoughts on the future were interrupted as they walked around a bend and almost immediately she spotted an opportunity to escape. Extremely dense bushes are known hideouts for partisan ambushes, and in this part of Bosnia they were especially prevalent. Jumping into the bush, her gamble paid off.\n\nAs if on command, four men emerged from the bushes with automatic rifles in hand and quickly gunned down the young Croatian. Donning scruffy beards and Sajkaca caps, they were undoubtedly Chetniks. Saying very little to each other, Katarina and Mirko followed the men off the beaten path, to a village flying a flag that she almost never thought she'd see flying again; The black Chetnik standard alongside the royal flag of Yugoslavia."
 twrcroatia.9.a:0 "At last - a breath of freedom."
 
 twrcroatia.10.t:0 "Our Father"
 twrcroatia.10.d:0 "They were packed tightly into the chapel. Shivering and barely conscious, a group of about fifty people sat down in the makeshift pews. "Brothers and sisters, I'm so glad you could all make it today." The chaplain said. He received no reply outside of a cough or two. Friar Tomislav Filipovic was not unknown to his "congregation", a sadistic priest known to most as "Brother Satan", he had been tasked with the forced conversion of Serbs and Jews to Catholicism. A job which he did with brutal diligence. "I am disappointed to hear that many of you haven't yet seen the light of God, but there is still hope for you all yet. As a token of my generosity, I grant all of you a chance to repent before entering God's Kingdom." Motioning to the guards to lock the doors in the chapel, Friar Tomislav donned his gas mask, as lingering yellowish gas began flooding the room. Some people inside panicked and ran for the door, only to be fired upon by the now masked guards. Others huddled together quietly weeping, slowly turning into a hellish choir of coughing, gradually fading into quietness. Making the sign of the cross with his golden crucifix, Friar Tomislav began giving the suffocated remains of his victims their last rights, muffled by his mask."
 twrcroatia.10.a:0 "From ashes to ashes, from dust to dust."
 
 twrcroatia.11.t:0 "A Terrible Swarm Of Avengers"
 twrcroatia.11.d:0 ""On the ground!" Milos ordered. Five of the prisoners were forced onto the ground. Kneeling in front of their captor, their heads were forced down. commandant Ljubo Milos pulled out a crumpled piece of paper and adjusted his glasses to read it. He looked largely uninterested in the whole ordeal, sweating through his cap and having another hand on his gun. "You have been accused of collaborating with international Jewry, communist forces and robbery. In the power ordained in me as commandant you have all been sentenced to death by firing squad." Crumpling the paper and putting it back in his uniform pocket, the condemned glanced up and saw what would be their grave, a hastily-dug shallow pit just outside the camp. It still had shovels in it from yesterday, and the bottom was already beginning to collect water and become muddy. "I SAID DOWN!" Milos barked, slitting one of the prisoner's throats and kicking him into the pit. "Guards, aim your rifles." the commandant said, looking towards the five soldiers which stood behind the remaining four prisoners. Milos looked at his watch, he was 15 minutes late to a luncheon with his bosses, and tardiness was something that was unacceptable in the Ustase High Command. Looking to quickly get this...minor delay over with, the commandant finally gave the order."
 twrcroatia.11.a:0 ""Ready, aim, fire.""
 
 twrcroatia.12.t:0 "The House"
 twrcroatia.12.d:0 "Franjo looked at the house. It was a nice-looking place, two stories and red siding. He looked at Marko. "What's the deal? It seems fine to me."\n\nMarko sighed. "A Jew family use' ta live here and the Ustashe didn't clean the place when they got done, so we gotta do it."\n\nAs they stepped inside, it became obvious why they were here. It was impossible to hide the trail of blood that came down the stairwell and descended into the basement. Some disgusting stench filled the air. Franjo was already cautious. "Are you sure there's nobody here?" he asked Marko, who nodded in response.\n\nThe first room was the kitchen, which was disturbingly grisly. Blood was smeared across the walls and floor, with two cutting knives on the floor. Before Franjo took a step, Marko stopped him. "Hey, hey, hey! Don't step in the glass!" When Franjo looked down, he saw the shards of... something glass all over the floor.\n\nNext came the basement. As they walked down the stairs, Franjo noticed the stench was even worse. And then, when he opened the door..."
 twrcroatia.12.a:0 "They found the family."
 
 twrcroatia.13.t:0 "The Lorkovic Trial"
 twrcroatia.13.d:0 "Mladen Lorkovic is a controversial figure in Croatian politics; Although an early follower and close friend of Pavelic, many of his theories are connsidered...a bit too radical to say the least. Although a firm believer in the state's racial policies, he is still considered by many to be a moderate and by extension a threat to the state's hardline positions. We will put Lorkovic on trial for seditious activities, and hopefully this growing thorn is snipped before it's too late."
 twrcroatia.13.a:0 "We eagerly await the traitor's fate."
 
 twrcroatia.14.t:0 "The Lorkovic Trial - Guilty"
 twrcroatia.14.d:0 "Good news from the courtroom today, the treasonous Mladen Lorkovic has confessed to the horrible crimes of undermining the state. As per state policy on the treatment of subversives, the sentence is death, to immediately be carried out by firing squad."
 twrcroatia.14.a:0 "If you do wrong, be afraid; he does not bear the sword in vain."
 
 twrcroatia.15.t:0 "The Lorkovic Trial - Not Guilty"
 twrcroatia.15.d:0 "Terrible news! Mladen Lorkovic has escaped the justice of our court systems by having his case dismissed altogether, undoubtedly bribing the judges involved."
 twrcroatia.15.a:0 "The rat escapes justice."
 
 twrcroatia.16.t:0 "Parliament Meets"
 twrcroatia.16.d:0 "For the first time since the Zagreb Uprising, the Croatian State Parliament has met in a hastily-convened emergency session. Immediately, The Supreme Ustahe Council was officially and unanimously decided do be the governing body to select the next Poglavnik, succeeding the recently-murdered Ante Pavelic.\n\nFrom there, however, the state of Parliament quickly descended into chaos, as the Council attempted to propose acts that would clamp down on what limited opposition remained, citing the possibility of several parliamentarians being involved in a conspiracy with Jews and freemasons to restore the rights of Serbs. Several HSS lawmakers walked out in protest, while others, along with multiple Bosniak MPs, berated their Ustashe counterparts, declaring that if the latter passed Council's proposals, "Croatia would be torn apart."\n\nAfter a brawl between Ustashe and HSS members broke out on the floor of the State Parliament, a vote was finally called, resulting in a victory for all of the proposed acts. Though it is not, as the Council representative claimed, the Jews or masons, The highest levels of Croatia's government have been infiltrated - in truth, by the societal tensions that threaten to, as said by a Bosnian lawmaker, tear the country apart."
 twrcroatia.16.a:0 "Let us get to work."
 
 twrcroatia.17.t:0 "Rioting in Sarajevo"
 twrcroatia.17.d:0 "The death of the Poglavnik has shaken our state to the very core, and our precarious provinces in Bosnia are no exception. Likely being bought off by bolsheviks and Serbs, these rabblerousers have been calling for ridiculous requests like 'more rights' and 'self-determination'. These deviants must be dealt with immediately."
 twrcroatia.17.a:0 "Send in the Home Guard!"
 
 twrcroatia.18.t:0 "Bosnian MPs Pick Sides"
 twrcroatia.18.d:0 "With the future of the Croatian state uncertain, many Bosnians within parliament have become almost as restless as the protestors in Mostar and Sarajevo. with all of them opposing any further action against their riotous brethren. Without any actual progress made after six hours of what sounded more like a seedy tavern than a national parliament, the session subsequently ended without anything accomplished and the Bosnian politicians quickly leaving Zagreb at a suspiciously-quick pace."
 twrcroatia.18.a:0 "Why didn't we hang them when we had the chance?"
 
 twrcroatia.19.t:0 "Bosnian Independence Declared"
 twrcroatia.19.d:0 "The Independent State of Croatia's greatesst test has finally come; Citing years of mistreatment under the Ustase despite being considered equal citizens on paper, Mehmed Handzic, the informal spiritual and political leader of the Sarajevo ulema announced on the radio that the Bosnian people have chosen to finally pursue their own destiny after decades of servitude to others. Already, reports of militiamen loyal to an independent Bosnia have seized armouries and began expelling Ustase politicians. In response to this act of high treason, the government has declared the revolt a 'Lawless rabble funded by jewry' and mobilized the Home Guard against the revolt."
 twrcroatia.19.a:0 "Za dom spremni!"
 
 twrcroatia.20.t:0 "What Was Once a Village"
 twrcroatia.20.d:0 "Amar rode his way home from the battlefield upon a horse. Traversing fields and valleys for days, he longed for that which he had missed in the heat of battle. Fighting for Bosnia had brought about a most dreary homesickness - one which could only be quenched by returning to the place he had been born, grown up, and still lived. He had not served in the invasion of Yugoslavia, and was ambivalent in regards to Ustashe rule. When the bugle call of Bosnia rang out, however, he answered.\n\nYet, he could not help but worry. He had heard tales of the Ustashe burning down villages in response to their men going to war against them. Although he dismissed these worries as unfounded and assured himself that there was little reason for concern, he was met with a different sight upon arrival.\n\nFrom the trees hung the corpses of the dead, filled with bullets. The torched remains of houses still dotted the landscape, touched by nothing since terror had reared its ugly head. Amar looked around, struck with the pangs of an indescribable emotion. The mutilated bodies that laid upon the ground and among the trees were not just the nameless, unknown comrades that he had seen on the battlefield. They were his friends. His neighbours. His wife and his daughter - victims of unspeakable horrors in their own right.\n\nThe village that Amar had once called home was no more."
 twrcroatia.20.a:0 ""My occupied homeland, trampled village, my home...""
 
 twrcroatia.21.t:0 "Partisan Execution"
 twrcroatia.21.d:0 "So, Alija thought, this was going to be how his life ended. Not as a hero of the country, dying of old age in some old folks' home, but amongst the trees of Perucica. The Ustashe had found him atop a tree, shooting down at them from the canopies. At first, he had been pretty good at shooting back, getting them and dodging out of the way. However, all it took was one bullet to make its way through his leg, and he had fallen to the ground. Now, here he was, bruised, scratched up, bleeding, and about to be the victim of an impromptu execution.\n\nOne of the soldiers took photographs of him, moving around, unspeaking. "Just kill me already," Alija growled, pointing his rifle at the photographer, "If you're going to take pictures, have it be my body." One of the more unkempt soldiers glared at him, before being held back by his (apparently higher-ranking) comrade. "It's fine, we won't kill you," he said, "But tell us something first."\n\n"Wait, what? Uh, fire away." Alija said, smiling. The Croatian looked at him for a second, before dryly replying, "Ha-ha, very funny. Anyways, where are your friends?" The Bosnian partisan looked at him for a second. "What?"\n\nShooting the rebel in his other leg, the Croatian continued, "I said, 'where are your friends?'. After all, I doubt it's just you fighting." Looking up to him, grinding his teeth in pain, Alija groaned, sort of singing, as if he was part of a demented church chorus, "Nobody else! I grabbed my gun and went to war!" The Ustashe soldier sighed, "Well, we'll just leave you here, then," before shooting Alija once again, this time in the back.\n\nWatching the Ustashe disappear into the woods, Alija screamed at them, "Come back! Come back and kill me, you bastards! Don't just leave me here!" Clenching his teeth. He could do nothing, now. Both of his legs were gone, as was his spine. He couldn't move, except crawl on his elbows. All he could do was wait for the wild or the weather to take him - whichever came first."
 twrcroatia.21.a:0 "Death to partisans."
 
 twrcroatia.22.t:0 "Mountain Execution"
 twrcroatia.22.d:0 "Marko stared at the captured partisans, and saw each face looking back at him. A dozen or so captured souls, each staring back at him, with a mix of contempt and dull fear. They were Bosnian POWs, their base atop the mountain destroyed by an ambush. The Ustashe troops each were discussing what to do with the rebels, and Marko, as their commander, had to decide what to do with them. Thinking to himself for a bit, he came to a conclusion. "Kill them," he said abruptly to his adjutant, "Tell them to do what they please."\n\nHis adjutant saluted, and shouted the orders to the soldiers under them. Hearing their orders, the Home Guard began a transformation, like that of werewolves in old folklore, turning from mere men of war to beasts and monsters. The more merciful ones used bayonets between the ribs, as they had been taught. Others used such weapons without care of where they went on their victims, or used rocks, petrol bombs, or other methods of brute force to extinguish the life of their victims.\n\nThey made quick work of them. Within a few minutes, the only lives left on the mountain were Croatians. Seeing the aftermath, Marko remarked a few things to his adjutant, before they began their descent down the mountain and back to the road, as the hunt for Bosnians continued."
 twrcroatia.22.a:0 "No mercy."
 
 twrcroatia.23.t:0 "Falling Down"
 twrcroatia.23.d:0 "Atop the mountain, the last few survivors of the raid had been captured. Their camp had been attacked by the Ustashe, throwing petrol bombs without any warning. Only three had been left alive, and they were now being interrogated.\n\n"Please," the first one to be interrogated sobbed, "Let me go, brothers. I have only been roped into this fight by my friends. I know that we are the same people! Do not kill me, I have a wife at home! Please, brothers, I beg of you!" Laughing, the Croatian soldiers mocked him. "You're like a revolving door," one of them said, "Turning to whatever side is best for you!" Not accepting the soldier's argument, the brutes grabbed him by the legs and pulled him to the edge of the cliff.\n\nThe soldier shrieked in terror as he was held over the edge of the mountain. "Brothers, please!" he yelled out, "I fought for you against Serbia! We believe in the same things; death to anyone who is against Croatia! Please, do not kill me! I'll tell you anything!" The Ustashe soldiers, rather than listening to his pleas, poured some water down into his mouth and nose, and howled in monstrous laughter as they watched him suffer, and then, after whispering to themselves and coming up with an agreement, they released him.\n\nThe beasts watched silently as the soldier fell down the mountain. It was not, by any means, a clean fall from the top to the bottom, but a rough, rocky one. And then, when they were sure he was dead, they returned to the remaining two, their lust for blood quenched."
 twrcroatia.23.a:0 "The monsters come like rain, down from the mountains into the valleys below."
 
 twrcroatia.24.t:0 "The Headless Imam"
 twrcroatia.24.d:0 "The imam had been cornered.\n\nOn the field of battle, his fellow soldiers were strewn about, either having been sent from this world into the next or still groaning and writhing in pain, left to suffer at the hands of the Croatian terror. Yet he alone had been left alive and unharmed - either by act of Allah or by the hands of the Home Guard. Yet, within the back of his mind, the imam could not help but feel that living was perhaps something not always so great. Perhaps it was seeing his comrades moaning for their mothers on the ground, or the more selfish reason that he was in the Croatians' hands.\n\nThe soldiers of the Home Guard were brash and uncouth, frequently cutting the imam with their knives and brandishing their weapons at him, showing little regard for if he lived or perished. They joked amongst themselves of performing horrors against the Bosnian people; raping their women, killing their children, burning their mosques, and much more - all, unfortunately, exactly what the imam expected of such brutes.\n\nAnd then one of them spoke to his brothers in whispered tones, pointing back to the imam and making a slicing motion with his hand. To the imam's concern, the others nodded in agreement as they began to approach him. Slowly they came, smiling like the devils they were. The last words the imam heard were simple. "You'll look nice hanging on a mantle!" Before a roar of laughter and the swipe of a machete across his neck."

Many of these guns have been taken through quasi-legal methods, such as bribery and the black market. Fortunately, however, we have managed to buy plenty of other weapons through perfectly legal methods. With these arms, we shall bring control back over Bosnia, and restore our rule!"

And then, from the sky, he heard the buzzing of a plane - that of the Croatian Air Force. Taking cover, along with everyone else in the trench, they waited for the detonation of the bombs, the rain of dirt. And yet, there was nothing. Nothing more than a few leaflets dropped from the sky.\n\nLooking at the thin, orange paper, Ahmad could not help but chuckle. "Well?" the soldier next to him inquired, "What does it say?" Smiling still, Ahmad read it out loud; "We both agree, death to Jews - let us join forces, smash a brick into their ugly skulls!" Looking around, he found that his fellow fighters did not see it the same way. "They're right, you know," one of them said, "You and I both know that those Jews are the reason things are so bad in the first place."\n\n"You're insane," Ahmad laughed, "They're going to kill us, too. Just like the Jews." The other soldier turned to him, stating plainly, "And what's so bad with that? It didn't matter to me." And then, with his comrades watching in shock, the soldier climbed out of the trench, hands raised, surrendering himself over to the Home Guard."

"Fine," she said, "But take your big brother out with you."\n\n"Yay!" Vedad cried out, "Come on, Ivan, let's go!" As the two left to go play outside, their mother couldn't help but be worried, even as she cooked the chicken uninterrupted. What if something happened to them out there? There could be soldiers, mines, unexploded bombs, everything that could possibly hurt them! She couldn't take it! They had to come back in.\n\nBefore the mother could get outside to call them in, however, she heard an explosion, as the ground seemed to shake. Rushing outside as fast as she could, she called for her boys. "Ivan! Vedad! Come here!" No response. Walking around to search for them, she nearly threw up when she saw their bodies. They had been struck directly by the bomb.\n\nTurning her head upwards, she screamed in anguish as a mother of nobody, and saw the Croatian bomber fly off."

Wasting no time in condemning the late Ante Pavelic and his gangsters, many within the clergy have become outspoken critcs against "anti-Croat Nazism" and have even gone so far as to demand the excommunication of any and all Croatians who still follow the Ustase's banner.

He had to get out of the country, starting with Zara. He would get to Malta, and then a flight to South America. Paraguay, perhaps?\n\nAs the propeller began to turn, Navratil thought more about who would take him in. There was always the possibility of claiming that he was opposed to the Ustase. He could put on a sorrowful face as he claimed that he was unaware of the true scope of the genocide. Surely, they would believe him - he had been told he was a very convincing liar.\n\nCrossing the country and moving towards Zara, Navratil noticed that fuel was running very low. He would have to make a landing somewhere close by. According to his estimates, he must have been close to the Kornati archipelago. He was free!\n\nThen, the plane ran out of fuel and went into a nosedive. Navratil panicked, and as the plane plunged towards the ground, he said his final prayers before he perished."

He chucked quietly. These soldiers could not even aim straight. His train of thought was interrupted, however, by another shell firing - followed by a loud explosion, as the church shook from the impact.\n\nBrzica heard a crash from behind, and found that rubble had fallen in front of the door, trapping him within. Next came another shell, and part of the right side of the church caved in, nearly killing the commander if he had not gotten out of the way in time. As one more shell fell, he looked upwards, and heard another boom, taking the southwestern corner with it. The ceiling fell upon Petar Brzica -  and this time, there was no escape, as he was entombed within the church's ruins."

Continuous shelling, bombing, and battle had riddled the building with holes, and everything was in disarray. The two saw the door to his office. Kicking it down with brute force, they entered with their guns to find... nobody. The room was deserted, and evidently in a hurry, as many documents were strewn about, with an aura of chaos in the room.\n\nThough they looked through the whole building, the whole city, Viktor Pavicic was not there - he was not anywhere.

He did not want to be taken captive and slaughtered by a bunch of Jewish Bolsheviks, Serbs, and masons, that was for sure.\n\nLuburic knew what he had to do. He would not let them take him alive and kill him - he would kill himself, instead. He imagined their happiness to be capturing him, only to find his body!

They would see him among the ashes and execute him. It did not matter to Milos, though. Croatia would rise again, like a great and terrible phoenix.\n\nAs he lined the inmates up, he stared upon them - their pitiful, starving bodies. He took hold of his rifle, and decided to inspect one of them. Laughing at and mocking the shivering skeleton of a man, he eventually struck the inmate with a bayonet. As he did so, he heard a scream come from his right, and was pushed to the ground.\n\nWhat followed was a cacophony of violence, as those who were to be slaughtered rose up against the slaughterers. With an orgy of gunfire and blood enveloping him, the last thing Ljubo Milos saw was the barrel of a gun."

Yet still, the soldiers fought on. Eventually, however, they became sick of seeing their comrades die at the hands of Francetic. They spoke to each other in hushed tones, and one by one, they stopped firing and aimed their weapons upon their commander.\n\nFrancetic quickly realised what was happening. He tried to reason with them, saying that they would live on to fight in the mountains. Then, he became enraged, shouting at them that they would all be executed by the government if they tried to kill him. Finally, he pleaded with them, begging for his life to be spared.\n\nYet the soldiers paid little mind to his babbling. After he was done, one soldier asked if he had any last words.

Still, he enjoyed the calm that it brought him, and it enjoyed his soothing voice - enough for it to stop thrashing in the branches.\n\nEvery day, the hoopoe became smaller. Trapped between branches, it had nothing to eat. Its body became smaller and its wings weaker. Soon, it stopped trying to flap them. The bird thrashed less each day, as its chirps turned to cries. Ivan did not understand at first, but eventually he learned. Yet, there was nothing he could do, with the tree stretching so high. He left, promising to return.\n\nEarly the next morning, the hoopoe's breathing grew weaker. Its eyes closed, and its beak followed with them. Some crows flew by, and picked at the dead bird, eventually tearing it apart and carrying the parts as they flew away. When Ivan came to the forest, he looked for the hoopoe.

And then he was gone. Plenty of stories went around, ranging from the mundane, such as him having been killed, to the more unrealistic, such as him joining the Chetniks or the partisans in Serbia, to the whimsical, such as him having left for Italy or America. Nobody knew where Marko was, or if he was alive at all, but few believed he still lived in Croatia.\n\nAnd then, one day, Marko was back. But it was not the same Marko as the old days. He was thin and bruised, and looked as if he had aged thirty years. He no longer spoke about anything. Not the Turks, not the Serbians, not history. One day, one of the villagers, Dunja, walked up to the amateur historian and asked, "Marko, what happened when you were in Visegrad?"\n\n"They burned it all," Marko said, his eyes staring through Dunja with the chill of icicles, "They slaughtered us like we were nothing but pigs.

Although officially recieving many praises throughout the country, the situation in Croatia now represents something similar to regime of Ante Pavelic.

croatianews.41.d:0 "When the Ustashe rule in Croatia collapsed, many wondered what would happen to Hungary.\nBeing occupied after total defeat in the second Croatian-Hungarian war, most people believed a revolution would happen to topple the Ustashe administration, while a few believed that Ustashe retreating to hungary and trying to retake Croatia was a possibility too. Well today that question was finally answered, as fast as the Ustashe system in Croatia fell, so it did in Hungary. The remains of the Army, lead by Geza Lakatos, have successfully overthrown the government led by Mehmed Alajbegovic and stopped all the policies of the previous government. The new government, even while it is a military dictatorship, has been greeted with many celebrations and support from the hungarian populace."

Sure he liberated his own homeland and the whole peninsula, and its not like he had doubts himself, but then the people needed a strong leader, and he didnt want to show any cracks. But being a leader of this importance at such a young age was starting to take a toll on him, and everybody could see it. \nThen, he looked at the stars, thinking about everything he had done, every person he has seen so far, remembering every step he took for the liberation of his country. And at that moment somebody opened the door. \n"Karlo!" \nIt was one of the people who helped him the most through his journey, Budimir Loncar. \n"What do you need Budimir?" \n"Look, I know this leadership thing is taking a toll on you, everybody sees it." \n"Is it that obvious?" \n"Yeah, even that bastard Hebrang is getting concerned about you." \n"I'm honored" \n"Look, how about this" - Budimir proposed - "I have a great friend up there in the Alps, I could talk to him and you can pay a visit there, you can relax in the mountains and read all those books you like in peace." \n"You wont leave me alone until I accept it, will you?" \n"Nope" \n"Give me few days to think about it, okay?

Artukovic was met with a thunderous applause from the public, smiling, he thought how far he had come. Usurping power after that incompetent bastard Pavelic died, and leading Croatia on the path to Glory, and as the final step, Artukovic has been given the title "Blessed Poglavnik" by the clergy, this was of course, the final move to consolidate his control over the Church.\nBut even though many would like to believe it, the public enthusiasm was all but genuine. Artukovic was the main ideologue of the Ustashe movement, designer of the race laws, architect of terror, and with his coming to power, all the hope for Croatia has withered away.\n For the people of Croatia, there is no longer such a thing as day. The sun no longer shines its bright rays, as if a terrible, endless night has been cast down onto these lands, forever cursing its people to an eternity of damnation. There is nothing in Croatia, save for the Ustase. The sun no longer shines upon Croatia. There is nothing but the dark night, never to end."

There was, of course, brutal oppression of political oponents and the "undesirables" but this did not bother Francetic, because he stoically believed that these sacrifices were necessary for his Croatian paradise, without any threats like Serbs or Jews who were constantly destroying his home, their home, the Croatian home.\nEntering the tavern, Ustasha's joyous voices were heard, his soldiers were already drinking, celebrating their victories, drowning them in alcohol and friendly games in which the one who loses goes crazy, because he had to pay for a tour of drinks. Francetic sat down with them for a while, talked, checked what was happening in the city, and decided to leave their company, not wanting to interfere with their game.\nHe noticed a couple of newspapers on the table, and after reading the title, he was really convinced that the guy in the game who lost, could boast that he still won together with his brothers.

Breaking that established thought, the partisans could freely say that the fight was not in vain, no matter how much it seemed so at first, second, third before that fourth view forced people to go together with the state to campaign against fascism.\nIn a speech by Hebrang, praising Stalin's idea, he swore allegiance to it, believing that Yugoslavia would be able to show what it means to be loyal and loyal to Stalinists by fighting fascists and revisionists, who were at the heart of previous problems in establishing justice. , the yugoslav utopia that all its inhabitants have longed for in so many years behind them.\nThis was no longer a question of whether and how the work would be done, but a question of when the right idea would be realized, with the urge for freedom, before everyone could say the sentence they had always dreamed of:"

Artukovic was found guilty on all charges and sentenced to hanging.\nNext on the chopping block was Jure Francetic, Francetic was accused of all the acussation as Artukovic, and sentenced to hanging. The court proceeding went quicker than usual with him.\nThe worst offender was most certainly Vjekoslav Luburic, he was accused of mass killings, tortures, executions, burnings, raidings...etc. Luburic plead guilty on all accounts and was senetenced to hanging.\nThere were many more high-ranking officials who met their fates that day, but one of the most interasting was of the ex-friar Marko Filipovic, nicknamed "Brother Satan", he was accused of everything Luburic did and more, the court had to be more guarded than usual for his trial, and people outside were chanting for his death. Filipovic was sentenced to death, of course, but he did not meet his fate as decided, as soon as he walked out the courthouse, the angry mob surrounded him and beat, stomped and stabbed him to death, no person was prosecuted for his death, as the government saw this incident as nothing more than a bastard meeting his fate.\nOne man was seen on all of the executions and even the death of Filipovic, when asked why he watched every execution of an Ustashe official, the man said he hated them so much, he had to go to every single one to "Make sure those motherfuckers are dead.".

Three candidates have proven to be most popular and supported. First is §CVladimir Bakarić§!.  Bakarić has a long legacy of communist activity, supporting the titoist movement in the CPY,  that is the idea of fighting against classical communism, and advocating communism with Yugoslav characteristics. Although Bakarić's health brings to the table the question for how long will he be able to rule the nation, his supporters stand firmly with him.\n\nNext is §RAndrija Hebrang§!, a staunch Stalinist, Hebrang deeply believes in the solid and strong industrialization preached by Joseph Stalin. His authoritarian beliefs are a concern among the younger members of the communist party, and he is widely dennounced by the supporters of Mrazović and Bakarić for his Autocratic Tendencies. Nevertheless, he has a gathered a following that cannot be ignored.\n\n Last but not least of the three is §OKarlo Mrazović§!. Considered to be the least radical of three, his policies include a mix of various ideas throught the leftist spectrum. Mrazović is also the proponent of the §OIllyrian Movement§!, an pan-slavic idea formed during the Croatian National Revival in the middle 19th century. There have also been rumors of Mrazović's sympathy towards the ideas of Democratic Socialism although they have not been offically confirmed.

 ##Navy Tree##
 CRO_Mediterranean_Navy_Expansion:0 "Mediterranean Navy Expansion"
 CRO_Mediterranean_Navy_Expansion_desc:0 "Though Croatia officially has a navy, in truth it is little more than a few fishing boats with rifles mounted upon them. If we truly wish to be respected in the region, we are going to have to make serious improvements. Perhaps one day we shall even have a navy to rival that of the powers that share the Mediterranean with us, like Italy and Britain."
 CRO_Improve_Our_Dalmatian_Dockyards:0 "Improve Our Dalmatian Dockyards"
 CRO_Improve_Our_Dalmatian_Dockyards_desc:0 "As we hope to form a navy of any significance, we must look towards our coast: the lands of Dalmatia, with such cities as Split, Dubrovnik, and Makarska, has historically served as a land of seafarers. However, the dockyards of these lands are not made for fearsome navies, but for merchants, who sail the Mediterranean in search of profits. We must rebuild our dockyards into ones fitting of our (soon-to-be-)great navy!"
 CRO_Mass_Produce_Destroyers:0 "Mass Produce Destroyers"
 CRO_Mass_Produce_Destroyers_desc:0 "The destroyer is a ship that has served our naval interests well, the ship services well enough and is cheap and easy to construct. With our modern dockyard technology and vested interests in greater naval dominance, large fleets of destroyers serve us well. Mass producing the destroyer helps secure the Medditerrean Sea as the large numbers can help cover the span of the sea easily."
 CRO_Begin_the_Battleship_Programme:0 "Begin the Battleship Programme"
 CRO_Begin_the_Battleship_Programme_desc:0 "While Destroyers are a handy ship to make, they can't form our entire navy alone, Battleships have been a neglected idea, by ignoring them we haven't been able to compete with other navies. While this program is a great idea, it's just a start and opens up a future for expansion in larger ships with more powerful armaments."
 CRO_Expand_Naval_Doctrines:0 "Expand Naval Doctrines"
 CRO_Expand_Naval_Doctrines_desc:0 "Now that we have made strides towards a bigger navy, we need competent officers and theories to put this navy to use. Our destroyers and battleships are good enough alone so funding Naval Theory institutions and programs, civilian and military will prove helpful. We need our best and brightest to command our ships and funding these programs will lead to a more efficient navy that allows us to cover more sea with less ships safely."
 CRO_Compete_Against_The_Italians:0 "Compete Against the Italians"
 CRO_Compete_Against_The_Italians_desc:0 "The Italians are not merely inhabiting our sea, but our water, as well. Their actions are unacceptable, acts of war against the Croatian people. But we cannot risk such things just yet, for they would surely result in our obliteration. The Regia Marina will not run us over, for the Croatian Navy will be able to put up a strong fight - one just like David and Goliath. We say to those who mock us, saying we could never hope to challenge the "mighty" Italian Navy; The Adriatic is Croatian, and we'll never let it go!"
 
 ##Army Tree##
 CRO_The_Croatian_Army:0 "The Croatian Army"
 CRO_The_Croatian_Army_desc:0 "The Croatian Army has gone far since its founding with our independence in 1941. Still, however, there are many things which continue to hold it back. The primary issue, besides a lack of professionalism, is a lack of modern equipment. Most of our units continue to use German, or worse, Austro-Hungarian rifles. Another problem emerges in the fact that our army has not yet made for itself a single doctrine, instead focusing more on such matters as killing Jews and Serbs. If we hope to be feared by more people than defenceless civilians, we must modernise our armed forces - and fast, for the horizon looks grim if we do not."
 CRO_Modernise_Our_Land_Forces:0 "Modernise Our Land Forces"
 CRO_Modernise_Our_Land_Forces_desc:0 "We have started a modernisation program, in the hopes of improving our army from the state it is in currently. Unfortunately, however, a divide has already formed over how this modernisation will happen. Many support expanding our usage of artillery and building an experienced core of troops. On the other hand, more radical voices have proposed building up our armoured forces and mechanising our troops. Which way shall it be?"
 CRO_Learn_from_the_Invasion_of_Greece:0 "Learn from the Invasion of Greece"
 CRO_Learn_from_the_Invasion_of_Greece_desc:0 "The High Command has decided to focus on a doctrine of experienced men and heavy use of artillery. This doctrine is based on the Italian invasion of Greece, which, though ultimately not fully successful, saw the use of mountaineer divisions and heavy artillery bombardments. Through intense analysis of this conflict, we are able to come to our own conclusions and develop a force able to defend against any opponent."
 CRO_Shell_Them_to_the_End:0 "Shell Them to the End"
 CRO_Shell_Them_to_the_End_desc:0 "Our generals have created a plan on how to use our artillery in the most effective way - mass bombardment. We will rain shells upon the enemy nonstop, weakening their forces until they are too worn down to resist our attacks. This, unfortunately, will require the reorganisation of our logistics to handle the near constant supply of shells we will need to keep up the bombardment - but it is worth it!"
 CRO_Expand_Artillery_Production:0 "Expand Artillery Production"
 CRO_Expand_Artillery_Production_desc:0 "Coinciding with our new doctrinal advances, we have started to produce more artillery to equip our troops with. Using technological advancements, we are now able to pump out shells and guns at numbers never seen before. Our production shall surely frighten and concern any of our potential enemies, but it is not enough. If we hope to succeed, we need more artillery, so we must keep those factories running, all day and night."
 CRO_Less_Men_More_Experience:0 "Less Men, More Experience"
 CRO_Less_Men_More_Experience_desc:0 "It is clear that total conscription will not get the job done. We need to reform the system of drafting soldiers, so that we do not have incompetents, but true men who are capable of fighting the threats that we face. We must be a small force of great fighters that makes our opponents quiver in their boots and run away, and that is not something that more men will do. As the old saying goes, quality is desired over quantity - and we will accept nothing but the best!"
 CRO_The_Special_Ground_Forces:0 "The Special Ground Forces"
 CRO_The_Special_Ground_Forces_desc:0 "The best of our troops have been recruited for a new military initiative, The Special Ground Forces. These men will be trained for extreme combat, mountainous conditions, and guerilla operations behind enemy lines. These soldiers will become the core of our new army - one that is experienced, prepared, and ready for anything that might face our nation, be it Americans, Italians, or Serbs."
 CRO_Expand_Our_Military_Companies:0 "Expand Our Military Companies"
 CRO_Expand_Our_Military_Companies_desc:0 "We have reached the last step of our modernisation plan, as our armed forces have grown to an extent unforeseeable by our predecessors. New recruitment drives and propaganda showing off the improvements to our army have achieved their goal. While more soldiers are always great, some have worried this will tarnish the experience of our army. To allay these concerns, new training exercises have been created, pairing up experienced troops with green recruits, which will help maintain quality as the army grows."
 CRO_Look_to_Yugoslavias_Demise:0 "Look to Yugoslavia's Demise"
 CRO_Look_to_Yugoslavias_Demise_desc:0 "We cannot take the invasion of Greece as an example for our military's future. Greece, simply put, is not Croatia. Instead of taking ideas from a completely foreign country, we must look to something more familiar; the invasion of Yugoslavia. The demise of that chimera state was won by speed and the German blitzkrieg doctrine - something we must hope to take into account as we formulate a new doctrine for our nation's armed forces."
 CRO_Lightning_War_Doctrine:0 "Lightning War Doctrine"
 CRO_Lightning_War_Doctrine_desc:0 "The Germans did not conquer Europe through trench warfare, or through use of artillery. They did it through speed. The primary focus of the Germans' blitzkrieg doctrine, used in Poland, France, the Low Countries, and Yugoslavia, is a rapid breakthrough of enemy forces, followed by encirclement. In order to fully realise the potential of this doctrine, we must give further autonomy to tank division commanders. These commanders, akin to Germany's great generals such as Rommel and Manstein, will lead Croatia to victory through speed - our very own blitzkrieg."
 CRO_Expand_Tank_Research:0 "Expand Tank Research"
 CRO_Expand_Tank_Research_desc:0 "The state of Croatian tanks is rather... lacklustre, to say the least. Any potential enemies that we may face, such as the Hungarians, the Italians, or the Serbs, could easily overpower them, by some estimates without even using tanks of their own. We must take inspiration from the Germans, with their Europe-conquering designs such as the Panzer and the Tiger. From this, we shall create a truly fearsome tank that belongs to the Croatian nation!"
 CRO_Motorise_Our_Forces:0 "Motorise Our Forces"
 CRO_Motorise_Our_Forces_desc:0 "Unlike most of Europe, where cars and vehicles are commonly used, the horse is still the primary transport for troops and supplies in Croatia. This must change. We have recognised that, to fully achieve victory, we must have infantry that are able to keep up with our armour. The motorisation of our army will not only help the speed of our troops, but logistics will also be greatly improved, for new trucks will quickly get supplies to the front much faster than the neighbouring farmer's mule."
 CRO_Import_German_Motorised_Equipment:0 "Import German Motorised Equipment"
 CRO_Import_German_Motorised_Equipment_desc:0 "Our industry is struggling to meet the army's new demands - something with which our army's staff has (rightfully) panicked over. Thankfully, our diplomats will try to cut a deal of sorts with Germany. This deal would allow us to import their motorised equipment, like Opel, halftracks, and so on. If Germany accepts, we will (hopefully) be able to complete the motorisation of our armed forces."
 CRO_Mechanisation_of_the_Army:0 "Mechanisation of the Army"
 CRO_Mechanisation_of_the_Army_desc:0 "After much effort, we have mechanised the Croatian Army. Infantry can be seen traveling in new German halftracks down the roads. Army trucks are spotted unloading crates of ammo at supply depots. In massive army parades, new tank models are shown off to the adoring crowds - and pleased generals. Our army is ready; to not only defend Croatia, but to go on the offensive, as well."
 
 ##Air Force Tree##
 CRO_Croatian_Air_Force:0 "The Croatian Air Force"
 CRO_Croatian_Air_Force_desc:0 "The Croatian Air Force has been a neglected branch, and has had quite infrequent use throughout the past years. If we wish to put up any sort of resistance in the case of invasion, or even provide air support during any invasions of our own, we absolutely need a modern air force. For starters, we must call up a few experts in the field, to form a new plan for the future."
 CRO_Construct_New_Airfields:0 "Construct New Airfields"
 CRO_Construct_New_Airfields_desc:0 "The first step to any modernisation of our air force will be to further construction of our air force's military airfields. This will ensure the ability to have a large number of planes able to take off at the right time - not only to protect the furthest border regions, but to take to the skies if we are under attack by foreign foe. The airfield is, all in all, an invaluable resource to any air force worth its weight, and we will need more of them to have a chance in the sky."
 CRO_Bomber_Programme:0 "Bomber Programmes"
 CRO_Bomber_Programme_desc:0 "Unfortunately, our Air Force is dominated by antiquated bombers, dating all the way back to the Balkan Wars and the First World War. With short ranges and no ability to drop reasonable loads, we need to start anew and by funding a programme our bombers. With this, we can hope to help speed along funding for new bombers. Upgraded and new bomber planes will allow us to increase our offensive capability from the air and make offensives easier for our infantry, knowing that the skies belong to them."
 CRO_Improve_Our_Old_Fighters:0 "Improve Our Old Fighters"
 CRO_Improve_Our_Old_Fighters_desc:0 "Much like our bombers, our fighters are outdated and date back to the dark days before the Ustashe even existed. Fortunately, they are not as in bad condition as our bombers, as well as being made after 1914 - not to say that they are much better. If we were to get in a fight with another nation, they would be shot down in seconds. Funding official fighter research programmes will allow us to catch up quickly, and get a new generation of fighter planes in the air."
 CRO_New_Air_Doctrines:0 "New Air Doctrines"
 CRO_New_Air_Doctrines_desc:0 "If Croatia even hopes to stand a chance against her neighbours in Serbia and Hungary - not to mention Italy, Germany or America - we must look into new doctrines. We know now that the skies are just as important as the seas or the land; if we lose there, we lose our theoretical war. We must look for a single, modern doctrine to put forwards, in the hopes that we will be able to put up a fight against our enemies, however strong they may be."
 Research_for_the_Age_of_Jets:0 "Research for the Age of Jets"
 Research_for_the_Age_of_Jets_desc:0 "So far, all of our efforts to catch up with the world have been relatively successful. Now, with much of that out of the way and dealt with, the opportunity to prepare for the future is before us. We see what von Braun is planning in Germany, and what the Americans are doing. While many have called it a pipe dream, we dream of a day where Croatian jets fly through the skies - the most advanced in the world!"

 CRO_The_Croatian_Armed_Forces_desc:0 "The Situation of the Croatian Armed Forces to be bad is and understatement, our military is plauged with corruption, lack of training and of course lack of proper and up-to-date equipment, if we want our place in the world guaranteed, we must invest in improving our army, navy and the airforce."
 CRO_Improving_The_Navy:0 "Improvement of the Navy"
 CRO_Improving_The_Navy_desc:0 "With us bordering the italians, our navy needs to be in an excellent condition if we are to contest their monopoly on the adriatic sea. We must begin preperation for navy improvement immediately!"
 CRO_Expand_The_Submarines:0 "Expand Submarine Production"
 CRO_Expand_The_Submarines_desc:0 "Submarines are proving more and more to be excellent in naval combat, we must invest in intensifying the production of them, so even if we dont get a lot of ships, we at least have a deadly navy that noone can spot."
 CRO_Land_Doctrine:0 "Expand Land Doctrines"
 CRO_Land_Doctrine_desc:0 "If we are to stand up to our neighbours, we must start thinking of new strategies, as well as expanding already existing ones, manpower is precious and we dont want to waste our men dying for nothing, for if we do, we have already lost the war."
 CRO_Improving_The_Airforce:0 "Improving the Airforce"
 CRO_Improving_The_Airforce_desc:0 "The Battle in the air is almost as, if not more important than the battle on the land, and if we are in a war, and we lose the air war, we lose the war in general, so we must expand and improve our airforce greatly."
 CRO_The_New_Military:0 "The New Military"
 CRO_The_New_Military_desc:0 "We have done it, we have modernised our military, while not as big as the german or american one, ours is professional and will fight of any invader with ease, we will no longer be slaves to foreign powers, Croatia shall be free evermore!"

 ##Industry Tree##
 CRO_Ending_the_Depression:0 "Ending the Depression"
 CRO_Ending_the_Depression_desc:0 "Croatia is in a state of siege. A siege not by any foreign nation, any rebel group, or anything of the sort, but a siege on our economy. Since independence, we have struggled to keep anything resembling an economy afloat, while other nations have managed to succeed and prosper at least a little bit. Croatian leadership has accused many different groups of being responsible for it - Jews, Bolsheviks, Roma, Serbs, and so on and so on. However, if we are going to survive, we can't just blame other people for our problems forever. We must fix our economy."
 CRO_Empower_the_Alliance_of_Syndicates:0 "Empower the Alliance of Syndicates"
 CRO_Empower_the_Alliance_of_Syndicates_desc:0 "The Alliance of Syndicates, Croatia's largest and only government-sponsored group of unions, will be instrumental to our economic success. If we empower them, and give in to at least a few of their admittedly long list of demands in regards to workers' rights, we will hopefully be able to ensure our future prosperity - even if it is at the cost of short-term economic benefit."
 CRO_A_New_Four_Year_Plan:0 "A New Four-Year Plan"
 CRO_A_New_Four_Year_Plan_desc:0 "In 1936, Germany began a policy known as the Four-Year Plan, to recover the economy lost by the First World War, the failure of the Weimar Republic's economy, and the Great Depression. This programme was massively successful, making Germany an economic and industrial powerhouse. We should look back on what other european powers were doing, and formulate our own policies to create a new four-year plan for Croatia."
 CRO_Exploit_Our_Steel_Industry:0 "Exploit Our Steel Industry"
 CRO_Exploit_Our_Steel_Industry_desc:0 "If Croatia is known for one thing, it is her steel industry. Steel is one of Croatia's largest resources, and one of our few exports. In order to economically recover, our economic ministry has suggested a new programme of exploiting our steel industries and exporting far more steel than we previously did. While some have protested on the basis of "worker's rights" and such, we can assure them - they will receive the same rights as anyone else in Croatia!"
 CRO_Fix_the_Food_Prices:0 "Fix the Food Prices"
 CRO_Fix_the_Food_Prices_desc:0 "With our depression, the prices of food have skyrocketed, and many Croatians can no longer even afford a bite to eat. This situation is a national humiliation; we must bring food prices down to an acceptable level, and keep them there. That way, we will be able to hopefully greatly reduce the number of starving Croats, and feed our people. However, unfortunately, this comes at the cost of hurting our farmers economically - something we will have to look into in the near future."

However, instead of advocating for an industrial society, we must support our nation's great farmers. They are the strongest members of society, always rolling with the punches that they are dealt. For all their hard work, we must reward them with subsidies."

With us reducing our reliance on Germany, that leaves us in the rather problematic predicament that nobody wants to trade with us.

Curiously, the city of Zagreb and the region of Croatia also shares this reliance on steel. Therefore, in order to boost our central region's economic prosperity, we must expand our steel mining operations in the region.

For all this, we need our road system to be completely flawless. While the recent improvements have undeniably been a major success, a new plan for the so-called "Northeast Highway" has been established.

But with the rebellion finally over, the question of what do with these territories and their autonomous status now remains in jeopardy as many in the government wish to rule the region directly from Zagreb or to placate the muslim population.

Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac had become a significant figure in Croatia in the years of Ante Pavelic as a figure that espoused a strong connection between a Christian Croatia and the Holy See, but was also known for his quiet opposition of the Poglavnik's methods of maintaining order. Having sufficiently distanced ourselves from the Ustase, perhaps we can get Stepinac to endorse our new government; a move which would undoubtedly boost our government's popularity within religious populace."

These ideals can only be achieved through the realisation of a socialist society. And now that we liberated our people from the grips of it, we can begin our long journey towards socialism. We will accomplish that via democratic socialism. Democratic socialism is a political philosophy that supports political democracy within a socially owned economy. It would of course, be wrong for a bureaucrat in the government decide what is the best for the people, thus, we must allow the people to decide what is the best for them themselves. Clearly this is what Marx would have wanted, so that the people have a voice for themselves, and not be opressed by the ruling class.

But with the rebellion finally over, the question of what do with these territories and their autonomous status now remains in jeopardy as many in the government wish to rule the region directly from Zagreb or to placate the muslim population.

 CRO_STARTING_GUI_DESC:0 "This is the screen of the government of the §YIndependent State of Croatia§!. First of all there is the §gPoglavnik§!, the leader of the country itself, next to him is §gthe Second-in-Command§!. Below the Poglavnik and the second in command is the poglavnik's inner circle; each of the persons in the inner circle has their own loyalty and influence in the country. §RShould the influence of the person grow too high and loyalty too low they might attempt to overthrow the current Poglavnik or even the Ustaša regime itself!§!"

 USTASE_REGIME_DESC:0 "§gThe Ustaše, full name Ustaša - Croatian Revolutionary Organization§!, is a Croatian fascist and ultranationalist organization. The ideology of the Organization is a blend of fascism, Roman Catholicism and Croatian nationalism. The Ustaše support the creation of a Greater Croatia that would span the Drina River and extend to the border of Belgrade. The movement emphasizes the need for a racially "pure" Croatia and promotes genocide against Serbs—due to the Ustaše's beliefs grounded in anti-Serb sentiment—and Jews and Roma via Nazi racial theory, and persecution of anti-fascist or dissident Croats and Bosniaks. The Ustaše views the Bosniaks as "Muslim Croats", and as a result, Bosniaks are not persecuted on the basis of race. It was founded as a nationalist organization that sought to create an independent Croatian state. When the Ustaše came to power in the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a quasi-protectorate puppet state established by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany during the European war, its paramilitary wing became the Ustaše Militia. However, the Ustaše lack support among ordinary Croats and never accrued any significant support among the populace. The Ustaše regime was backed by parts of the Croat population that during the interwar period had felt oppressed in the Serb-led Yugoslavia. Most of the support it had initially gained by creating a Croat national state was lost because of the brutal practices it uses, making the resistance movements, mostly the partisans, grow more support day by day."

 Vokic_gui_desc:0 "Ante Vokić is one of the more controversial figures in the Croatian Politics. Having ascended to the position of the leader of the homeguard, he wields enourmous power and leverage. While his skills have proven useful to us in the past, his loyalty to the regime is questionable at best, some even accusing him of working with the denounced parties. Whatever the case, §Rwe must not let him get too much power, or else he will most likely try to overthrow the government when the time is right!§!"

Although not the most prominent member in politics, Francetić will do whatever necessary to stop the resistance to the regime, using brutal and inhumane methods if necessary."
