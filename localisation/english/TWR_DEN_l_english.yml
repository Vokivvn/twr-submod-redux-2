Villages and towns across the nation are razed systematically for no reason other than the fact that Werner Best commands it. The Danish Waffen-SS and  Einsatzgruppen have solicited the absolute fear of the populace and for those who choose to resist a shallow grave awaits. Not even the collaborators have been spared as those spineless cowards in the DNSAP and the Frikorps Danmark are tossed into the mass graves along with those they conspire with to remove the honourable rule of the SS. Denmark is far from prosperous yet there is no question as to who rules it. \n\nThe Obergruppenführer however is an ambitious man with ambitious ideas, his dreams of a Europe reorganised along racial lines cannot be achieved by an isolated Nordic nation being burned to the ground by SS death squads. Naturally the path to such power can be found across the border in Fatherland where Himmler's branch of the SS seek to permanently liberate the people from decadence and the trappings of the Judeo-Bolshivik conspiracy. If Best is to advance any further in his ambitions then it is imperative that we fulfill our duty to both the fatherland and Herr Himmler!"
