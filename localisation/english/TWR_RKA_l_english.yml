 #Leader Desc
 Arno_Schickedanz_DESC:0 "Arno Schickendaz was born on December 27, 1892, in Riga. During his schooling in Russia, he graduated from the Polytechnic, and during his schooling, he met Alfred Rosenberg, who was one of his main links during the rise of the NSDAP within the Weimar Republic. During his rise within the NSDAP, he was a staunch follower of Hitler's policies and was characterized as a member of the old guard, which also advanced his political career, and in 1927 he published a book in which he referred to Jews as parasites and pests. In 1930, he joined the APA with the help of his friend Alfred Rosenberg to continue his career inside. It was not until 1936 that he gained a more serious position in politics, and in 1939 he was one of the few people who criticized Hitler's decision to sign a pact with the Soviet Union.\n\nWhile he spent much of his time as a bureaucrat, his friendship with Alfred Rosenberg resulted in his eventual recommendation to the post of Reichs-Generalresident of the Kaukasus. Since then, Schickendaz ruled with an iron fist, brutally suppressing whomever Germania deems to be undesirable, while maintaining close ties with certain local leaders."

 RAK_Kaukasus_Civil_War_desc:0 "Since the beginning of our rule, the Kaukasus has been plagued with insurrection and disorder. This colony was never stable at the best of times and these are not the best of times. We've ignored these underlying problems for years but we cannot do so any longer. The wolves are at the door."

 RAK_Chemical_Bombing_desc:0 "Because we're on our own out here, we need to resort to drastic measures to protect our rule. We have surplus chlorine gas left over from the war. We may as well put it to good use. The mountainsides are full of native partisans. We will have to smoke them out."

 RAK_Repair_the_Oil_Wells_desc:0 "Now that the Kaukasus is back in our control, we should repair the derricks we destroyed during the evacuation. It's going to be expensive but it's for the best that we tore them down. At least the rebels weren't able to make use of them."

During the formation of this Reichskommissariat, the German leadership placed heavy emphasis on appeasing the locals. In the directives laid out by Alfred Rosenberg, the Reichskommissariat Kaukasus government was not allowed to conscript locals (except for Russians and Ukrainians) to serve as forced labour, and ethnic communities are granted autonomy within the territory.\n\nTherefore, thanks to these strict guidelines, outside the capital, the Reichskommissariat is running on a feudalistic system."

 RKA_oil_extraction_desc:0 "The Kaukasus is only tasked with one major goal - providing oil to the Reich. Germania does not care how this oil is extracted, as long as they get as much of it as they can. However, combining this daunting task with the great autonomy of local communities, the Reichs-Generalresident office came up with an ingenious plan. In exchange for security and German support, local leaders are tasked with resource quotas that they must fill. In addition, areas that could not be administrated properly are granted to German conglomerates, allowing them to extract resources for a cut of the resources."

On paper, this group's goal is to "liberate the lands up the the Urals to achieve self determination for all ethnics". However, the reality is, VSOU functions like a glorified Eastern European mercenary company with fascism sprinkled throughout. Currently, the VSOU is mainly busy with raiding Soviet towns and providing paid security services to private facilities operating in the region. For example, sites operated by Rheinmetall and IG Farben are under VSOU protection."
