#Leader Desc
Konev_DESC:0 "Marshal Ivan Konev was born on the 28th of December, 1897 to a peasant family in Western Russia.  Spending his early life in parish schools, Ivan would quickly become a Lumberjack by the age of 16, possessing an unusually high mental drive.  He was drafted into the Imperial Army during the first World War, only to join the Reds after being Demobilized with no work prospects.  A personal protege of Kliment Voroshilov, Konev would attend top military schools in the interwar period, and rose to the rank of general by the time of the Great Patriotic War.  During the war, Konev showed excellent strategic intuition, and quickly became a leader of the Red Army,  despite the failure of the war.  \n\nWhen the union was defeated, Konev quickly radicalized even further.  He began to feel that the world had betrayed the Union to the Germans, and that all of the west, not just Germany, was their enemy.  This only continued when the USSR began to fracture, and Konev was disgracefully sent to deal with the Tatars and VSOU around Kazan on Beria's order, an attempt to soft-exile the powerful general.  Now he spends his days fighting a German sponsored insurgency, and watching Beria sully the good name of Socialism in Perm. However one day soon, the time may come to deliver justice to not just Beria, but the entire World."
Lazar_Kaganovich_DESC:0 "Considered one of Stalin's closest confidants, few don't recognize the name Lazar Kaganovich, and there are even fewer that know of his deeds. Born to a family of Jewish-Ukrainian peasants in 1893, he joined the Bolshevik cause at a young age, spurring recruitment at the shoe factory where he worked. A commissar by the October Revolution, he led communist revolts in Belarus and made a name for himself in crushing the Basmachi rebels of Turkestan with great efficiency and brutality. A notable ally of Joseph Stalin in his rise to power, Kaganovich rose alongside him becoming General Secretary of the Ukrainian SSR's communist party in 1928. Tasked with the job of collectivizing the Ukrainian countryside and liquidating the rich kulaks, his methods cemented his place at Stalin's side against the weaning Left and Right opposition within the party.\n\nWith the disappearance of his beloved General Secretary, "Iron Lazar", a nickname earned for his ruthlessness, found himself marginalized when Lavrentiy Beria's NKVD clique returned to the old New Economic Policy. Fearing the worst, he allied himself with Stalin's son Vasily and joined the eccentric young Stalin's "Crown Prince Clique" in Kazan with the hopes of rebuilding the Stalinist dream within a broken Russia. With Vasily's resignation, his chance may have finally arrived."
Vasily_Stalin_DESC:0 "It is often said that the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children, but in the case of Vasily Iosifovich Stalin, perhaps the sins are cumulative. The infamous son of Stalin was born in 1921 and had lived a relatively comfortable childhood until his mother’s suicide in 1932. Becoming a heavy drinker and rowdy troublemaker after her death, Vasily would eventually get his break from academic failure after barely passing the Kachinsk Military Aviation School in 1940.\n\nThe Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union presented a unique opportunity for the young Stalin to make a name for himself, however, as the German Blitzkrieg brought the USSR closer and closer to collapse he found himself more often staring at the end of a bottle than behind a cockpit. When his father unexpectedly disappeared it broke young Vasily, and his superior officers even wondered if he would take his own life. Instead, he joined Ivan Konev’s ultravanguardist clique in the Kazan Pacification Initiative.\n\nNow having overcome impossible odds in outmaneuvering both his former ally and the corrupt bureaucrats of the Beria regime, Vasily Stalin hopes to bring the Cubs of Russia back together under his late father’s vision by any means necessary.

KZA_The_Tightest_Of_Schedules_desc:0 "We have a lot of work to do to get this country back on its feet, and the problems are simply too many to be able to focus on more than one at a time. An organization that will monitor our actions will have to be established because we can no longer work like this, our bureaucratic body is too anarchic and scattered to be able to function normally if we put it under pressure and burden of the already mentioned problems. Only by introducing a new schedule, proper distribution of our goals, and prioritization of the agendas that we must implement, will we be able to start a real and functional campaign to restore stability in Kazan."
KZA_Maintaining_Our_Current_Strategy:0 "Maintaining Our Current Strategy"
KZA_Maintaining_Our_Current_Strategy_desc:0 "For now, our domestic policy seemed very successful, and by further fueling the aggression of our policy, we will only worsen the already shitty situation in which we find ourselves. We will continue to implement the plan we have developed so far with the same methods, with the hope that our faith in this will prove justified because if we do not succeed in this, we will fail."
KZA_Aggravating_Our_Current_Policies:0 "Aggravating Our Current Policies"
KZA_Aggravating_Our_Current_Policies_desc:0 "Only a strong and solid song resolves all conflicts that can befall us. Our current policy is extremely mild for the rebels and terrorists who rose against us intending to destroy everything we have created so far. By strengthening the already existing measures that we have introduced to deal with them, as the introduction of new measures that will be far sharper and harsher than the current ones. We must not allow our heart-soft will when it sees vodka to lose the war with terrorists because our future depends on this fight!"
KZA_The_Spectre_Of_The_Idel:0 "The Spectre Of The Idel"
KZA_The_Spectre_Of_The_Idel_desc:0 "Tatar rebels are just one unnecessary thorn in the side that threatens to infect the local terrain if we do not deal with them according to the harmonized rules we have introduced. If we allow their terrorist groups, as well as their people, to settle in excessive numbers, in the coming years, perhaps even decades ahead, we will witness more massive uprisings led by Tatar nationalism that will swallow us up. They must be stopped at all costs, whatever is in front of us as a problem or Tatar."
KZA_Collectivizing_Tatar_Pastoralists:0 "Collectivizing Tatar Pastoralists"
KZA_Collectivizing_Tatar_Pastoralists_desc:0 "The Tatars hold too much land and property in their hands. Their wealth sometimes cannot be measured while our most valuable and best people suffer hungry, sick, broken under the roof that leaks while some worthless creatures get rich. These estates will no longer be theirs because several divisions will be sent to regions inhabited by Tatar pastoralists who have allowed themselves too much and who have given themselves too much luxury. The introduction of strict seizures of their landholdings, as well as the forcible transfer of Tatars from their land, will bring our people little relief while helping the state to provide a solid and secure ground for economic maneuvering."
KZA_Allowing_Loyal_Masquoes_To_Function:0 "Allowing Loyal Mosques To Function"
KZA_Allowing_Loyal_Masquoes_To_Function_desc:0 "Loyalty is rewarded fairly, this law has always been valid everywhere, including in our country. Tatars want to maintain their national identity through their faith while our policy towards them was somewhat tolerant, but now the direction in which our policy is conducted must decide which side we want to go. If we compile a list of all mosques who agree with our policy, we can compromise with their leaders on less autonomy, of course for those who choose to be loyal or are already there, thus ensuring less tension between our forces and Tatar rebels."
KZA_The_Founding_Of_Kaliningrad:0 "The Founding Of Kaliningrad"
KZA_The_Founding_Of_Kaliningrad_desc:0 "For the sake of relocating our administration, and of course, to be able to relocate the surplus of Russian immigrants who arrived in our country, we must consider the option of starting the construction of the "Kaliningrad" project, which will be smaller but will serve the goals we need. Of all the options we have considered so far, the Tatar region will be the best for this project because it provides sufficient scope for further coordination of our actions in this sector of the state."
KZA_Russofication_Continues:0 "Russofication Continues"
KZA_Russofication_Continues_desc:0 "The campaign we started to eliminate the Tatar identity as well as the aspiration for independence itself is proving successful and does not raise as much dust of trouble as we primarily expected it to happen. If we continue at this pace and with the current intentions of the government, which are proving successful, we will finally be able to solve the problem posed by Tatar separatism. They will no longer be Tatars, they will become Russians."
KZA_Maintain_Perm_Resettlement_Programs:0 "Maintain Perm Resettlement Programs"
KZA_Maintain_Perm_Resettlement_Programs_desc:0 "In the fight against the Tatars, we realized that the numerical, ie ethnic overpowering of our opponents in civilian form is a legitimate strategy that will prove to be extremely important if we look at the long-term consequences. There may never have been any excessive benefits from Perm, but their policy we have taken seems to be doing its job. We must not stop here, moreover, if we decide to continue with this policy that Perm introduced, we will finally defeat the dirty Tatar separatists and get rid of them once and for all!"
KZA_Allowing_The_Language_To_Endure:0 "Allowing The Language To Endure"
KZA_Allowing_The_Language_To_Endure_desc:0 "How a nation speaks is difficult to defeat, especially when it is used for nationalist purposes to achieve the introduction of terror and instability directed against a legitimate government and its inhabitants. We must not attack their right to speak, at least not for now if we can't do anything else, but we will ease the restrictions on the use of the Tatar language and script to calm down the separatists who do not stop using everything they can against us."
KZA_Attempt_Complete_De_Tatarisation:0 "Attempt Complete De-Tatarisation"
KZA_Attempt_Complete_De_Tatarisation_desc:0 "We must not be more gentle! We must act more aggressively because this problem is spiraling out of control day by day, threatening to destroy us if we do not decide to stand resolutely for information and do not oppose them the way a state should oppose separatists and terrorists! The Tatar foot and the Tatar voice will no longer be heard walking or speaking when we meet them. This struggle will last until we defeat the last fragment of their faction when we finally succeed in pacifying the Tatar region!"
KZA_Forcibly_Close_Known_Mosques:0 "Forcibly Close Known Mosques"
KZA_Forcibly_Close_Known_Mosques_desc:0 "Their mosques are a refuge for their separatist aspirations, they are a danger to the stability of the state and we must not allow them to perform any duties until we decide that they can return to their old activities. This blow will hit them hard, it may even ignite a fire, but if we look at the long-term consequences, this will be a strong step backward for their fight and the will to resist our government until they forget that there was anything worth that fight. They will send several divisions to solve this problem, with or without force."
KZA_Disbanding_Tatar_Associations:0 "Disbanding Tatar Associations"
KZA_Disbanding_Tatar_Associations_desc:0 "The last step with smaller operations against Tatar nationalism is to fight their bureaucratic stakes within our state that we have allowed them to establish. Now, our kindness towards their desire to have their representatives has returned as a strong shot in the balls, and we will not allow a handful of poor Tatar's to make fun of us. Our government has made a decision - their bureaucracy will fall sharply so that it will never return..."

KZA_Shrinking_The_Tatar_ASSR_desc:0 "Even during the days of the Soviet Union, the Tatars enjoyed the gifted autonomy that they kept faithfully, but when you give a man one finger, he wants to bite off your whole hand and everything you hold in it. Their demands for independence have become an open terrorist war with us and only the destruction regarding their administrative system, after all the measures taken earlier, will be able to prevent the further advance of the rebels, their organization while supplies will be reduced to a minimum and instead of what they had so far. , we will reduce their existence to only a few points in Kazan, locking them from the rest of the world so that they could not create problems, giving them a completely new and reorganized ASSR."
KZA_Pacification_Complete:0 "Pacification Complete"
KZA_Pacification_Complete_desc:0 "It seems like the war is over, at least seemingly. The shooting has stopped, towns and villages are peaceful, roads are not being looted as before. The Tatars, at least those who are protesting against our government, will not even shake their heads to see if anything will change. It seems as if we have finally succeeded, that we have succeeded in defeating a handful of angry peasants who have realized how a trigger works. We must now maintain this state of affairs until we can back down from earlier measures without the risk of the Tatars returning with arms, stronger and more willing than ever to fight for independence."

We still don't have enough time to properly prepare our army, and those bastards from the north have already started attacking us! Fuck, if we can't figure out in a few weeks what to do with the army and what our war plans are, everything will go to hell and our entire operation to unite the Soviet Union will fail just because a jerk from Perm decided it was a good idea to they are attacking us now! May the will of Mother Russia help us because luck has left us at this moment!"

KZA_The_Mad_Dash_To_The_Capital_desc:0 "Take everything you have and focus the strike forces to move only towards Perm because their rotten and corrupt government can only function from there because if we manage to cut off the snake's head by invading Perm, we will be able to tear down everything they built and all that they wanted to take from us with that dishonorable ultimatum! The race has started, and the winner takes everything!"
KZA_The_Union_Under_The_Army:0 "The Union... Under The Army"
KZA_The_Union_Under_The_Army_desc:0 "Perm is insured, as is everything we’ve held so far. The army is ready in its positions to do what we tell them while all the politicians from Perm are sent to prison to wait for the punishment that we have prepared for them. What is our priority now is to secure all the remote parts of the Soviet Union that the Permians held because this sudden change of government led to the usurpation of several vital places outside our home, and we will need time to try to solve that problem."
KZA_Purging_Troublesome_Individuals:0 "Purging Troublesome Individuals"
KZA_Purging_Troublesome_Individuals_desc:0 "Despite everything we have tried to do with them, they continue to pose a threat that can cost us dearly if we release them after a “certain” time spent in a cell. To prevent the dust from being raised around their elimination, we will organize a short and efficient "trial" of all members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union who can have even a small influence on what will happen in Perm after the war. And after that, we will see what we have to do with the others..."

KZA_Shuffling_Military_Loyalists_Into_Key_Positions_desc:0 "There has been an influx of officers and generals, as well as soldiers in our ranks, but we cannot guarantee for all people that they will follow and respect what we tell them is necessary. We have enough people we can trust with confidence and allow them to hold important positions that will be of great importance to us in establishing order within Perm and beyond..."
KZA_Convening_The_Military_Transition_Plenum:0 "Convening The Military Transition Plenum"
KZA_Convening_The_Military_Transition_Plenum_desc:0 "We can't keep one whole creation under a military dictatorship too much, because the whole built system will collapse like a tower of cards. We have been planning the transition since the moment we invaded Perm, but now the situation is stable enough that we can resort to the idea of ​​convening a Plenum that will determine how we will do this job. The fate of the entire state is now in their hands."

KZA_VSOUs_Ever_Increasing_Grip_desc:0 "Followed by the Tatar uprising in 1950, VSOU managed to seize several more vital positions in the Kazan region itself since we came here. They represent a rebel group made up of all possible ethnicities that have defected from the current government and spread terror wherever they appear. Their power has risen sharply in recent months and we feel as if they are slipping out of our hands and that if this continues like this, we will no longer be able to keep them under control. Something must be done as soon as possible to be able to maintain stability, but the only question is which method will serve us well at this moment?"
KZA_Aggravating_The_War_In_The_Countryside:0 "Aggravating The War In The Countryside"

twrkazan.0.t:0 "A Cold Night In Kazan"
twrkazan.0.d:0 "Kazan's military headquarters is a lonely place, hounded by the spirits of night, and the terrors of the day. The freezing wind slammed into the glass panes of the building with a speed that briefly surprised the man sitting in the central atrium. In a military uniform decorated with nearly every medal under the sky, sat the man, reading a small inked sheet of paper. Ivan Konev raised his glasses, and more closely examined his latest counter-insurgency report:\n\nReport on Kazan Okrug Counter-Insurgency Operations\nJanuary 1st, 1952\n\nVSOU Summary:\nVSOU activity in the former "Transvolga Base Area" have continued to remain at steady levels since November of last year, despite actions taken by Red Army troops in the area. Suspected training bases within Okrug territory are mostly eliminated, with a prominent, albeit unlocatable, "Suvorov Complex" being the center of their operations in the region. VSOU assets in Reichskommissariat Kaukasia have continued to grow since 1950, however analysts suspect this is oriented towards seizing power in RKA itself, instead of a further push into the Military Okrug.\n\nTatar ASSR Summary:\nActivity of prominent Tatar nationalist cells has been on the rise since the previous report in December, as the NKVD execution of a local cleric has sparked an uptick in dissident activity. Previous authorization of increased NKVD jurisdiction in the region is advised to be reconsidered. However, NKVD analysts have affirmed that pacification is continuing at a reasonable speed and these incidents are of no concern. These same analyses were not made available to Military analysts however, and much skepticism should be applied to their methods and conclusions.\n\nThe General, shaking, removed his glasses, and proceeded to produce a lighter from his jacket pocket. Burning this most recent analysis on the Okrug, as he always did, he ruminated on the situation he was unwantedly in. There was much to be done."

On his suit, he proudly displayed his four "Gold Star - Hero of the Soviet Union" medals and one of his four "Order of the Red Banner" medals.\n\nHis entire list of decorations however, goes on. From three additional "Order of Suvorov - First Class", two "Order of Kutuzov - First Class", two "Order of Lenin", and an "Order of Red Star".

twrkazan_vasily.2.t:0 "Socialism in One Country"
twrkazan_vasily.2.d:0 "The Soviet Union must focus on its internal development rather than caring about the world around them.

However, his ideology is rumoured to be one of incredible radicalism and his ruling philosophy will greatly mirror that of his father."

twrkazan_vasily.6.d:0 "Spanning across multiple city blocks and dominating Novosibirsk's skyline, the Novosibirsk Megafactory Complex stands proudly in the city.\n\nThe future industrial production facility of the entire Soviet Union, this massive industrial complex operates around the clock. Every hour, a train load of coal enters the complex, the na trian load of products leave for other parts of the Union.\n\nThe city of Novosibirsk is now crowded and in a permanent state of smog. While it is too early to tell, health issues are beginning to appear in many workers. Our government however, have a perfect solution for this problem - we will just rotate manpower in and out of Novosibirsk to keep a healthy supply of workers."

twrkazan_vasily.10.t:0 "Stalin's Alliance"
twrkazan_vasily.10.d:0 "Despite being the son of Joseph Stalin, Vasily Stalin's authority is not god given. To maintain legitimacy and support, a web of political alliances within the Crown Prince Clique form a sophisticated support network for Vasily Stalin's rule. While this alliance kept itself together during the crisis periods, the reunification turned many of their ideological differences into irreconcilable conflict. Without a choice, Stalin must favour one side over the other, or else his administration would please none."

twrkazan.1.t:0 "The State of the Okrug"
twrkazan.1.d:0 "In the high command of this military okrug, two defined factions are now seeking political domination - the Ultravisionaries and the Ultravanguardists.\n\nCurrently the Ultravisionaries hold the most power. Ultravisionary ideas were organically developed after the devastating trauma of the Great Patriotic War. Their leader, Marshal Ivan Konev is also the commander of the Military Okrug. The Ultravisionaries support the expansion of communist ideology and advocates for a highly militarist society.\n\nOn the other side, there are the Ultravanguardists, also known as the "Crown Price Clique". Ultravanguardism evolved from Stalinism, it is also an ideological thought born out of the traumatic failures of the Great Patriotic War. As the name suggested, this faction of people rally around the son of Joseph Stalin, General Vasily Stalin. The Ultravanguardists believe in a literal form of "Socialism in One Country" and are extreme proponents of Stalinist economics.\n\nWhile these two factions are currently peacefully coexisting due to the threat of VSOU and Tatar insurgents, this status quo will eventually collapse."
twrkazan.1.a:0 "March forward."

twrkazan.2.t:0 "Dealing With Tatars"
twrkazan.2.d:0 "The unruly Tatars deserve no sympathy. For each Soviet citizen ruined, our forces would raze a Tatar village.\n\nWhile many would call this practice cruel, none should forget the fact that the Tatars attempted to establish their own German puppet state by collaborating with the Nazis. Their so-called "Republic of Idel-Ural" was a stab in the back, betraying the trust of the millions of Soviet citizens. Therefore, in our eyes, they are nothing but traitors."
twrkazan.2.a:0 "No room for traitors."

twrkazan.3.t:0 "Dealing With VSOU"
twrkazan.3.d:0 "Unruly bands of Slavic mercenaries following a fascist ideology, the VSOU is a dangerous but ultimately pointless organization. These fascists ignored the suffering of their own people, collaborating with the Nazis for their own personal gains.\n\nFor these traitors, we shed no tears. VSOU members and collaborators working with or for the VSOU will be executed. As further punishment, the family members and close associates of these VSOU traitors will forever be branded as borderline-traitors, an act of collective punishment that would make men think thrice before going over to the traitors."

twrkazan.8.d:0 "It was a night when the soldiers gathered not far from the tent where Konev was in person, trying to come up with a plan to win this race for Perm that hung in the balance because his promise to the soldiers could not be fulfilled, and it seemed Beria's troops to break through their defenses and force them to retreat, watching defeat after defeat and unnecessary loss of life as it was happening now, hour by hour, minute by minute and second by second.\n\n"Let me handle this." Said one of the generals who led this "coup" directed against Konev and his bad military decisions that dragged their army unprepared for war. Wanting to solve this seemingly hopeless situation as soon as possible and to try to reconcile with Beria to save as many lives as they can. "On three." Said the officer holding the gun pointed at the tent, waiting for a moment to rush inside and shooting at Konev who had no idea what might happen at this point. Konev only heard the footsteps coming behind him, not turning around, "What's the problem?" He asked before he could feel the lead creeping under his spine for just a millisecond. His head fell on the table, on the map, on the notebook that was written by his hand. Looking at each other, the general said, "What are you waiting for? Get out of here." Going outside, the general took over from Konev all the documentation he had there and his role as commander, at least for a short time."
twrkazan.8.a:0 "Spread the news. The madman is dead."

twrkazan.9.t:0 "Marshal's Triumphant Will"
twrkazan.9.d:0 "The explosion and the rush through the city quarters, the destruction of the streets as well as forcing the soldiers into dead ends at a very fast pace proved to be more than successful. The last fragments of Perm's defence gave way in front of Konev and his troops, who were inexorably stopped, even forced to fight to get to Perm as soon as possible, organising a race in which the winner would place a flag at the Perm political centre, which further motivated the soldiers. either they wanted to seize the glory or to humiliate Perm with a zeal in their hearts that no one could have at this moment.\n\nLed by the bulk of the cavalry he had hired for this special occasion to fly into Perm, Konev paraded, with his head held high, proudly crossed the threshold of Perm, firing at the sky in a sign of this victory. He told all the soldiers along the way; "Comrades, we have succeeded!" "You saved Mother Russia!" "The nation will make you into heroes!" and many other praises and ode that came with the victory.\n\nInvading like a hero rescuing his closest friend or partner from the clutches of trouble, Konev started shouting "Victory!" in the Perm government building as he was followed with the same zeal and pace by his soldiers who began checking all the other rooms in search of more important documents or people who could escape their bitter fate, their personal and political downfall. Konev then arrived at the office where Stalin had once resided, and for a time Beria, where the fate of the Soviet Union itself was decided. He stood proudly over a desk that once seemed so calm that he would say, "Let me experience a moment for this office to be clean of traitors.""

twrkazan.35.d:0 "Anadyr, a town surrounded in the vast remoteness of the Far East, stood an unremarkable grave stone on the side of a small monastery.\n\nThe old man looking after the grave told stories, stories of how inside this grave rest the remains of former General Secretary Joseph Stalin.\n\nA long journey from Kuybyshev to Anadyr took their group an insane amount of time. And apparently, near the end of it all, Joseph Stalin finally snapped and decided to leave his life behind.\n\nWhen other locals are asked about the man in the grave, many remember him being a quiet and reserved monk, barely talking and always had messy hair. While it is impossible to confirm if the remains are really of Joseph's, a piece of living evidence is more important than any proof.\n\nThe old man is Nikolai Sidorovich Vlasik, Joseph Stalin's personal secretary."

twrkazan_flavour.1.d:0 "There are not many of them left.\n\nLittle by little, the Tatar population dwindled, cut down by the brutal oppression of the military forces. Musa Calil, being a rare case of Tatar participating in local politics, somehow still maintained hope of achieving reconciliation between the Russian and the Tatars.\n\nHe dreamed and spoke in party committees, while his countrymen were being slaughtered by the same government which he serves."

twrkazan_flavour.2.t:0 "The Forgotten Son"
twrkazan_flavour.2.d:0 "In a dark, musky cell in Uralsk, a man spat out yet more blood as the interrogation continued. Having continued to profess his innocence, the man continued to mumble "Im not a fascist..." after each punch hit his jaw, which was by now surely broken. His interrogator however did not falter, and continued throughout the night. The man finally broke, unintelligibly confessing to all charges, predominantly of supplying VSOU linked fascists with ammunition. The interrogator, satisfied with a job well done, wiped the blood from his knuckles, and walked outside the cell. He continued until he was outside the building, in the cold familiar winter of Uralsk.\n\nYakov Dzhugashvili, or as his friends called him, Yakov Stalin, was not a man who you'd expect to extract information. In fact, until his appointment as head of the Kazan NKVD, he would've told anyone how much he despised the organization. Things had changed though. The Yakov who would've said that was gone, dead with his father. Vasily, his only remaining family, had been promoted, and needed all the allies he could find in his new position. Yakov, a man shunned nearly entirely out of the Soviet system, found himself one of the most powerful men in the Kazan district. Yakov became the right hand of Vasily, finally attaining the recognition that he was denied as a son of Stalin earlier in life. But he does not like his work, far from it. Yakov loves his work, for he can finally bring about the justice, and recognition, he has so desired in both his life and others.\n\nThere was a cough next him. A rather thin NKVD guard informed him of another prisoner arriving, in need of interrogation. Yakov, with the faintest hint of a cruel smile, reentered the building."
