AST_stable_growth_desc:0 "Australia has been in a period of sustained economic prosperity after the war against the Japanese Empire as economic ties with the growing United States are enhanced. This economic prosperity brought a steady stream of wealth and progress into the Australian society, and with the population growing soon, Australia seems poised to become a strong regional power."
AST_white_australia:0 "White Australia Policy"
AST_white_australia_desc:0 "The White Australia Policy is a controversial set of laws that aim to exclude people of non-European origin, especially Asians, Pacific Islanders and Aboriginals, from either immigrating or gaining full rights within the country. While the government has shown some intent to ease this policy, signs show that this policy is here to stay until a better alignment of the political climate allows its abolition."
AST_australian_empire:0 "The Australian Empire"
AST_australian_empire_desc:0 "With history standing on the side of Australia, and the transfer of European holdings in Oceania, she has become a sort of pseudo Empire, with territory spanning from Perth to the shores of New Caledonia. But this empire comes at a price - the new territories require constant maintenance, and newly acquired territories, such as former French New Caledonia, require expansion of the bureaucracy to allow their stable government, especially when so many of these inhabitants are suspicious of their new 'protectors'."
AST_red_resurgence:0 "Red Resurgence"
AST_red_resurgence_desc:0 "Becoming increasingly popular after the defeat of Japan, the fear of yet another conflict and major opposition to future involvement to European conflicts, the radical left has gained traction, expanding their ranks with impressive speed."
