the_advance_of_sovietification_category_desc:0 "The Great Vladimir Lenin once said "Communism is Soviet power plus electrification", proving that all men, even the greatest of Marxists, can make mistakes. Communism is much more than the mere combination of the state apparatus with industrialization, electrification, or some technological advance, Communism also necessitates an evolution in the society and culture which is trying to reach it. A new culture must emerge amongst the people, one which is directly identifying with the Soviet system, and not connected to some chauvinistic or nationalist past. Dialectical steps and actions must be taken to rectify this lack of understanding, and our state must begin an immediate §RSovietification§! of our states cultures, so as to fulfill the visions of the departed Comrade Zhdanov.\n\nThis process of §RSovietification§! is entirely unprecedented however, and will require a tremendous effort in many varying parts of the State. First and foremost, in order to build a new Soviet Identity the §GEducation of the Masses§! must be increased, in order to eliminate instinctual and learned habits of reaction. This can be done through a multitude of means, such as building new schools, increasing funding for the sciences, even actions such as building roads between villages can lead to §GHigher Education Rates§! amongst the people. However this process is not without resistance, as such heavy emphasis on ideological study and indoctrination is disliked by those within the masses who are lazy and enemies of the people, commonly referred to as §gApathists§! so named for their Apathy to §RSovietification§!. Our state must dialectically and wisely choose how to minimize the influence of the §gApathists§!, lest society regress, and all our efforts to complete §RSovietification§! fail."

NOV_Extending_Training_Periods:0 "Overhaul the Red Army"
NOV_Extending_Training_Periods_desc:0 "Much of the Red Army is technologically outdated, the result of over a decade of invasion, infighting, and isolation.

NOV_Condemning_Zhdanovs_Legacy_desc:0 "The legacy left by Zhdanov in our government is a dark and bitter one, the remnants of a tyrant's madness.

NOV_Purging_Voznesenskys_Cronies_desc:0 "In his long running efforts to centralize power around himself, for the sake of his damnable 'vision', Voznesensky filled many posts with incompetent yes-men and cronies of his, people who now possess neither the competency for their roles nor any true loyalty to us, quickly becoming a liability instead of merely a hindrance. We will conduct a necessary purge, arresting those deserving of nothing less and demanding the resignation of the rest, to improve competence and reliability in our government."

twrnovosibirsk.1.t:0 "The Novosibirsk Politburo Meeting"
twrnovosibirsk.1.d:0 "The Soviet Republic of Novosibirsk had been formed a few years ago after Zhdanov and his allies fled Beria's paranoid purges. By founding a rival government to counter the one in Perm, everything seemed bright at first, but the alcoholism that defined Zhdanov caused the Secretary-General's health to deteriorate rapidly. For the Novosibirsk government to continue, Zhdanov has convened a Politburo meeting. Leading figures of Novosibirsk and their Politburo have shown up, with Alexander Scherbakov, Nikolai Voznesensky and Nikita Khrushchev standing out. The session discussed the usual topics: the sorrowful state of Novosibirskan farming, the uneasy rival governments to the east and west, but perhaps the one topic that everyone had on their mind was the topic of succession. Even a fool could tell that Zhdanov did not have long left to live in this world, and whoever would succeed him upon his eventual passing would undoubtedly change the nature of the new government: perhaps even all of Russia forever."
twrnovosibirsk.1.a:0 "For now, though, the topic of grain taxes comes first."

twrnovosibirsk.2.t:0 "Zhdanov's Final Speech"
twrnovosibirsk.2.d:0 ""Countrymen..." Zhdanov could barely stand in front of the microphone "We sit at a crossroads. Now while i will not be here forever, and i may not live to address the issues of reunification. The future of the Soviet Union depends on the old generations to pass the torch of leadership onto the new, idealistic generation. One that can bring our glorious union out of the pits of despair and into a union of nations that Lenin himself would envy. Starting immediately, Nikolai Voznesensky will be made Premier of the Soviet Republic." His aides were taken aback by this sudden change in attitude, but continued to hold him up "We are surrounded on all sides, comrades. Beria's goons to the west seek to bring us into a new age of tyranny, while the traitorous Zhukov in the east wishes to undo everything that communism stands for! I implore you not just as your chairman, but as your friend: Do not be decieved by dangerous rumours of our inevitable demise! With the indestructible will of Marx and Lenin on our side, victory shall b-" Zhdanov's grand speech was suddenly cut short as one of the aides holding him up accidentally dropped him onto the floor. A loud shriek of feedback noise rang over the radio, and the transmission was cut."
twrnovosibirsk.2.a:0 "Well, uhh...he chose his successor?"

twrnovosibirsk.3.t:0 "The Premier is too Ill to Speak"
twrnovosibirsk.3.d:0 "Nikita Khrushchev met with a doctor who was dragged from an abandoned village to Novosibirsk. Waiting for him to come, he kept a guard at the door so that no one would see Zhdanov in his usual drunken state. Noticing the doctor coming, Khrushchev saw an old doctor who could barely stand on his feet. "Who the hell are you?" Khrushchev asked in surprise, expecting to see someone who might be younger or more professional. "I have been told to drag my ass to the General-Secretaries residence or I will bear the consequences, quote-unquote." "Those are my words. I need your help." Khrushchev said before opening the door to Zhdanov's office, carefully ensuring that no one was coming. "Don't tell anyone I called you, or I'll kick your ass all the way to Germania." The doctor noticed Zhdanov lying in a drunken daze. "And, doctor? What do you think?" The doctor examined him, measuring his body temperature, performing what few tests that he knew would conclude. "I think he has a mild fever, but it shouldn't be terrible. If he just rests for a few days, everything will be fine, but make sure he avoids stress or any kind of work in the next few days, that would be best for his health." "So what you want to tell me is that he got very drunk?" "Yes.""
twrnovosibirsk.3.a:0 ""Very well, doctor.""

twrnovosibirsk.4.t:0 "The Death of Zhdanov"
twrnovosibirsk.4.d:0 "Zhdanov woke up with a splitting headache, disoriented and confused, he looked towards his table. "How I hate when I am sober. Such a horrible state that one can find himself in." Zhdanov thought to himself, trying to drag himself to the table, but his legs betrayed him and he fell to the ground. He felt the coldness of the floor on which he lay climb up his spine, spreading throughout his body, and his eyes closed for what would be the last time.\n\nIt had been several hours since Zhdanov had collapsed until someone knocked on his office door. Without answering, they started knocking again, but this one a little louder. "What's going on inside?" Khrushchev asked the soldiers guarding the entrance to Zhdanov's office. They just shook their heads. Khrushchev then tried to open the door but realized it was locked. "Stand back, you bastards..." He broke down the office door and found Zhdanov lying on the floor.\n\n"Why are you just standing there, you jerks?" Khrushchev asked loudly, "Call the Politburo now!" He said. "What to do now?" Khrushchev began to talk to himself. "What do I do with this drunk ass?" He walked around the room, waiting for the Politburo.\n\nTen minutes later, Scherbakov and Voznesensky arrived at the office to find Khrushchev standing over Zhdanov. "What happened here?" Scherbakov asked, looking frantically at Zhdanov at first to turn his gaze to Khrushchev. "We had a ballet last night," Khrushchev answered him coldly so that he would start to get angry. "Our General-Secretary is lying on the ground unconscious! What do you think is going on?" Scherbakov then approached him as Voznesensky watched from a distance. "Don't you think we should call a doctor?" "Anyone left in Novosibirsk is not a good doctor." "What can we do next?" "Listen to me, shallow creatures... we'll call the doctors, they'll see if he's still alive...""
twrnovosibirsk.4.a:0 ""We will call them here and if they succeed, it's good. If they don't, well, he won't know...""

twrnovosibirsk.5.t:0 "The Death of Scherbakov"
twrnovosibirsk.5.d:0 "Sitting at his desk, dealing with the basic paperwork left behind by Zhdanov, who was not too upset to do the job but to drink, Scherbakov began to feel something pressing on his heart. This morning was no different from the previous mornings, Scherbakov was already accustomed to this and managed to drive away that pain later in the day, but suddenly a terrible pain in his heart caused him to sway in his chair and collapse, knocking everything down from the table. No one was at the door this time, the guards seemed to have been out for breakfast. Scherbakov tried to get up, but he fell back down, leaving him in an excruiating pain as his life slipped away. Arriving at the Politburo to discuss some trivial matters, Krushchev was supposed to meet with Scherbakov, but he was too late. Opening the office door, he just shook his head and said, "Fuck, not this again." "What should I tell them, comrade?" "We'll have to arrange a funeral for him.""
twrnovosibirsk.5.a:0 ""I can no longer remember who is alive and who is not.""

twrnovosibirsk.6.t:0 "The Emergency Meeting"
twrnovosibirsk.6.d:0 "Closing the door behind him and looking around to make sure no one was left behind as they entered the office, Khrushchev coughed to get the attention of the others. They were red in the face and sweaty from running to the meeting. Voznesensky knew why Khrushchev decided to bring them here, but he did not want to tell anyone while he wanted to say it himself. Taking his place at the table, everyone settled in. "All right. The fat man and our beloved comrade Zhdanov has left this world, but we must not allow sadness to overwhelm us during these difficult times for our republic."\n\nKhrushchev started, while Vosnesensky followed his body movements to try to understand what kind of game this lover of agricultural goods was playing. "... and my heart aches when I mention the name of our beloved friend, but we must be strong in deeds as we have been strong in words so far. The helm of our state now stands empty, and there are few who are ready and strong enough to do so. Take over to continue sailing through the struggle for the salvation of our Mother Russia." Khrushchev had never been so eloquent, Voznesensky thought to himself as he watched his determined face and pursed lips as he spoke. "When are you going to stop blabbering on?" Voznesensky thought to himself again as Khrushchev convincingly gave a speech in the name and glory of their friend Zhdanov, waving his arms as if he were hitting the ground with a hoe and lifting it upwards. "We have to be prepared for the strong blows we will survive from now on because there is no role model, no guiding star to guide us to survive this storm ..." "What a fucking manipulator ..." And Voznesensky continued to think to himself as he looked at Khrushchev, who was holding the attention of all present. "... so that we can decide, what will happen to us? What will happen to our state? And who will lead it to its rise?""
twrnovosibirsk.6.a:0 "A storm is coming..."

twrnovosibirsk.7.t:0 "The Future of Novosibirsk"
twrnovosibirsk.7.d:0 ""Do you think that this man, frivolous by nature, coming from a broken home, would turn into a man who goes around and spit on other people, to be a worthy heir of our beloved friend Zhdanov?" These were the words of Voznesensky, who pointed his finger at Khrushchev, watching him with anger in his eyes." "Comrades, this man, this so-called artist who has never seen hard work, either physical or intellectual, because we all know that his job is writing with the wind, thinking that he can be someone who will succeed in uniting Mother Russia! Someone who doesn't the will for that, someone who can't keep his words from falling apart, thinks he can keep Novosibirsk as a whole? Not to mention the Soviet Union!" "The way this man, this so-called politician, wants to lead this unfortunate state, with a look that holds like a bird's fatigue as he plays a dance called a striptease, a dance that terrifies everyone present..." "Look at this new Rogozhin! Do you want to come to power so you can buy a foreign passport? If so - then you could go free, go your dog, go to your old pack! Go to your masters who brought you here!"\n\nThe debate lasted for a full two hours, insulting more than constructively about their virtues and shortcomings than who was actually worthy of the title of successor to the Soviet Union. As the debate finally ended and the politburo wennt to vote, the results came in quickly, And the new appointed Secretary is..."
twrnovosibirsk.7.a:0 "Nikolai Voznesensky and the Zhdanovist line!"
twrnovosibirsk.7.b:0 "Nikita Khrushchev and the moderate line!"

twrnovosibirsk.8.t:0 "Khrushchev Takes Control"
twrnovosibirsk.8.d:0 "Following the vote after the sudden death of Alexander Sherbakov, and a nail-bitingly close vote within the presidium, he went out on the balcony to greet the gathered people who were informed of his victory and the speech he planned to give them. The people seemed elated at the news of their new leader being a man who wasn't obsessed with the bottle.\n\nComing out in front of cheering people, Khrushchev finally gave a grand speech to the people emphasizing his deep condolences for the late Zhdanov and Scherbakov. He went on to speak at great length about the rare opportunity the Novosibirskan people had in one day creating a new and better union: One that truly lived up to the standards that the great Vladimir Lenin once stood and fought for all the way back in 1917. It would seem, indeed, that a new era for Novosibirsk has just begun."
twrnovosibirsk.8.a:0 "With zeal in the heart, in new victories!"

twrnovosibirsk.9.t:0 "Voznesensky Takes Control"
twrnovosibirsk.9.d:0 "Only a few days have passed since Voznesensky's appointment as Chairman. Entering the Chairman's office, he felt like he had finally achieved the impossible. A mere twenty years ago, he had been running the entire economic state planning committee. He had survived the Great Patriotic War and all the destruction it brought his beloved Russia. The near-death experiences he had at the hands of Beria, and now coming out on top of a power struggle that itself felt like yet another attempt on his life. But all of that was finally over and he won the best prize of all: supreme leadership. Zhdanov's desk was extremely messy as always, and with the vodka bottles cleared out it looked almost like a disaster zone.\n\nNikolai organized the papers the best he could, and unsurprisingly they covered the biggest goal of all: Sovietification of the USSR. Voznesensky had always found the idea of a truly socialist society free of bourgeois influences extremely fascinating, and wondered "Maybe that drunken fool was right?""
twrnovosibirsk.9.a:0 ""Perhaps Zhdanovshchina deserves another chance.""

twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.1.t:0 "Khrushchev's Address"
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.1.d:0 "At the latest Party Congress in Novosibirsk, Nikita Khrushchev is making his highly anticipated address to Party members, his first since beating Voznesensky in the struggle for power. With his power now relatively secure, and potential rivals dealt with for the time period, Khrushchev feels that it is time to set out his agenda for Novosibirsk and, once reunification is complete, Russia as a whole.\n\nFirst, Khrushchev claims that the Novisibirsk government, along with all the governments claiming to be the legitimate successor state to the Soviet Union, have deviated from the 1936 Constitution. Promoting the system of Soviet 'Democracy' guaranteed during the era, every effort must be made to restore the Constitution to its full implementation and reestablish a stable government.\n\nSecond, he points to the implementation of Soviet cultural policy since the 1930s under the Zhdanov doctrine, and emphasises the need for reform. For now, Khrushchev gives little detail on this point other than standard party language on continuing to move towards socialism, but there are hints that greater changes will be revealed soon.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most significantly, the need for agricultural reform is emphasised. Khrushchev outlines his argument that while Soviet economic policy was hugely successful in building up the nation's industrial might, agriculture was left poorly reformed due to the necessities of the continuous war on kulaks and rapid collectivisation. His speech gains renewed energy as he talks of vast new farms across the untapped virgin territories of Russia and Kazakhstan, feeding armies of millions and a new renewal of the Soviet population and economy. There is no doubt that, above everything else, this agricultural campaign is his personal dream.\n\nAs the speech concludes and the expected applause fills the meeting room, few details of immediate actions have been outlined, but the Party is more aware of its direction under its new leader. Now, for Khrushchev, the Party and all the people of Novosibirsk and the soon to be united USSR, the job remains to bring this vision to reality."
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.1.a:0 "Let's get it done!"

twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.2.t:0 "An Address to the Military"
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.2.d:0 "With Zhukov's great betrayal, the Novosibirsk Soviet Government's armed forces had lost a significant portion of its fighting power. Marshal Rokossovsky has recommended that Chairman Khrushchev speak to the remaining officers in hopes of stirring their revolutionary spirit in the future wars to come.\n\nKhrushchev agrees with this assessment wholeheartedly, yet the matter of the speech's contents itself has raised much concern. A more realistic speech reminding the troops of their apparent disadvantage might be incredibly grim, but with the right choice of words, it just might give them the morale boost they need. On the other hand, a more hopeful speech might do a better job of whipping everyone back into shape, even if it sets some...unrealistic expectations."
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.2.a:0 "Remind them of reality!"
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.2.b:0 "Promise a brighter future!"

twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.5.t:0 "Border Guards Defect to Novosibirsk!"
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.5.d:0 "Regrettably, many of our border guards have defected, fleeing across the Ural mountains to join our ever more dangerous rival in Novosibirsk, Nikita Krushchev. Among those of importance defecting to Krushchev's cause are the high ranking officers Ivan Russiyanov and Mikhail Yenshin, taking many of their men with them. This event has left our armed forces with a shortage of both men and morale, and it is feared that Krushchev's government is about to match ours in might, if it has not already surpassed us."
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.5.a:0 "Those traitors!"

twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.6.t:0 "Tactics of the Red Army"
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.6.d:0 "Our Red Army is not what it used to be following Zhukov's great betrayal. But as the storm clouds of war gather over the Siberian warzone, we will need a new doctrine for our armed forces to follow in the inevitable wars of reunification."
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.6.a:0 "Prepare for a defensive war!"
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.6.b:0 "Prepare for a great offensive!"

twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.7.t:0 "Condemning Zhdanov's Legacy"
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.7.d:0 "Ever since the reign of Stalin, the Zhdanov Doctrine had defined cultural expression within the territories of the Novosibirsk government. Claiming that outside culture is from an 'imperialistic' world, under Zhdanov, all forms of creative expression, from literature to art to music, had to stick rigidly to the party line, following the rules of Socialist Realism. Any cultural works that were judged to deviate from this course were ruthlessly repressed, artists facing mock trials and repression.\n\nNow, in a shocking change of direction, Khrushchev condemned the Zhdanov doctrine in a speech to the Communist Party Congress. While never calling for complete freedom of expression or anything of the sort, Khrushchev declared that the ultra-narrow range of expression available under Stalin and Zhdanov had stifled Soviet culture, and the extreme suspicion towards the outside 'imperialist' world had caused inward-turning and backwardness within Soviet society. Citing Lenin's support for experimental and avant-garde cultural movements and Marx's promotion of global socialism, the harsh denunciation of Zhdanovism was rooted in his interpretation of Marxist theory.\n\nWithin the party this speech has caused a moment of confusion, with the sudden denunciation of the past and change in course being shocking to many high-ranking members. One thing is for sure, though - if Khrushchev is confident he is able to assert his own ideas and make such a clean break from the past, he feels, rightly or wrongly, secure in his power."
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.7.a:0 "A radical change in policy!"

twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.8.t:0 "A New Agrarian Revolution"
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.8.d:0 "With the great advancements in agricultural technology and techniques in the past couple of decades, there is a great opportunity for us to revolutionize the agriculture of the Soviet people, to ensure they are better fed than ever before. However, we are ultimately faced with a choice when it comes to this revolution in waiting: we can either import a new crop to grow to diversify and improve the health of our agriculture, or expand our wheat production so far as the land we control will allow us. Trying to grow a new crop is risky, but is overall better in the long run if it is successful; some agricultural experts claim that the crop of corn, which has long worked wonders in the Americas, may yet do the same for us. On the other hand, expanding wheat production is almost certain to be a success, yet it would not bear as much figurative fruit and produce a less dramatic revolution in the end. Few can say which option the Chairman himself will favor..."
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.8.a:0 "Can crops save the nation?"

twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.9.t:0 "The End of Perm"
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.9.d:0 "Against the odds, Khrushchev has done it. The armies of the Novosibirsk government, under the capable leadership of Nikita Khrushchev, has conquered and toppled the government in Perm, Beria's ugly legacy, and is now the undisputed successor government to the pre-war Soviet Union.\n\nOf course, many challenges still lie ahead. Eastern territories remain under hostile occupation. \n\nWith that said however, for now Khrushchev is victorious. In the Soviet territories under his control, he can begin to rebuild Soviet society in his image. There is much work to be done, but for now at least, it seems ever more certain to Khrushchev that has plans will soon be realised in full."
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.9.a:0 "Forward!"

twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.10.t:0 "The Spring Winds"
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.10.d:0 "Khrushchev's triumphant return to Perm signals the end of one era and the beginning of another. As loyal members of the Novosibirsk government's Red Army march through the city of their new headquarters, Khrushchev has asserted himself as the only legitimate successor to Stalin as leader of the USSR, a union now restored. Pretender governments and party splitters have been crushed, and all that is left to do militarily is liberate the Union's remaining territories.\n\nAlongside completing the reunification of the Soviet Union, a long road lies ahead for Nikita Khrushchev and his government. Ambitious programs of social and economic reform and rejuvenation have been set out to restore the badly damaged Soviet state to its former glory and beyond. The nation is badly battered, and many difficult challenges still remain to be overcome, but for now, spring winds are blowing through Perm and Russia after a long and dark winter."
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.10.a:0 "Onwards!"

twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.11.t:0 "The Politics of Reform"
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.11.d:0 "[NOV.GetLeader] has long talked of the need for the Communist Party and Soviet state to reform their political structures. Now, with time to plan with other reformers, more concrete proposals have been realised. While continuing to reject bourgeois multi-party democracy, [NOV.GetLeader] and his supporters are considering some level of internal democratisation of the Party, involving more formalised voting for party posts. Alongside this, some level of democracy would be restored for state officials, though of course all candidates would be members of the Communist Party.\n\nThe radical nature of these proposed reforms has caused serious opposition from some within the upper echelons of the Party, however. More conservative figures within the 'realist' faction bitterly oppose any form of democratic reform within the party and state structure. [NOV.GetLeader] will have to tread carefully with his reforms, lest he divide the party and turn too many of its members against him..."
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.11.a:0 "We'll find a way."

twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.12.t:0 "Resuming Elections In The Soviets"
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.12.d:0 "Elections in the soviets have been called all-across the union; even though some have critiqued the call to the ballots as rushed, considering the poor infrastructural state of many regions in the union, the central government has proceeded with the vote. The election went on flawlessly, regardless. Despite the government's efforts, the ballots couldn't reach several regions because of the aforementioned lack of infrastructure and transport.\n\nThe Communist Party of the Soviet Union was the clear winner of the election, though there is a little competition between candidates inside of the party. On one hand, we have Konstantin Chernenko, who represents the more idealistic, moderate elements inside of the party, on the other, there is Vasily Blokhin, who has cobbled up the orthodox and hardline people into a unified clique. Only one question remains, who of these two has come out on top of the supreme soviet?"
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.12.a:0 "Chernenko! let's pave the road towards utopia!"
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.12.b:0 "Blokhin! For an unbreakable union!"

twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.13.t:0 "The 20th Presidium of the Communist Party"
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.13.d:0 "After much difficulty and debate over how to go about forming a new politburo, the old Politburo that was convened under Beria has been dissolved, and the new created at Krushchev's direction. Infamous for its inefficiency and uselessness, the former Politburo was widely disliked but remained a major thorn in Chairman Krushchev's side after he restored legitimate authority to Perm, blocking initial attempts at reform and demanded that their role in the government be taken into account. Many are hopeful that the new Politburo, widely thought to be both well balanced and composed of younger patriots who want the best for their country, will be less plagued by the infighting that characterized the old and will serve as an effective governing tool once again."
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.13.a:0 "Only time will tell."

twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.14.t:0 "Yuri Orlov Joins the New Politburo"
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.14.d:0 "The Politburo has recently gained its newest, and youngest, member in the form of Yuri Orlov. Holding an interest in science and politics, some military experience, and not much else, this relatively unknown former officer in the Red Army makes up for his lack of experience through his political enthusiasm. A firebrand moderate and reformist, he has been labelled a rightist by critics but gained the support of many young pro-reform party members.\n\nNo doubt his appointment to the Politburo will be controversial within the party, and has the potential to cause major shifts."
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.14.a:0 "An impressive career progression."

twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.15.t:0 "Anastas Mikoyan Assassinated!"
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.15.d:0 "To the shock of many, not long after the election of the new Politburo of the Soviet Union, high level Krushchev deputy and ally, Anastas Mikoyan, has been assassinated under unclear circumstances. An Old Bolshevik, part of the Communist Party before the October Revolution, Mikoyan was a supporter of Joseph Stalin even in the early years and steadily rose through the ranks, becoming a member of the Politburo in 1935. Charged with transporting supplies and materiel to the front lines during the German invasion, he was widely considered to have performed this task admirably in spite of the ultimate defeat, and in the chaotic aftermath of that war's end became a close ally of Chairman Krushchev. It is unknown who is responsible for his death, with many rumors saying that it was a Kazakh terrorist plot. Ultimately, however, the truth of the matter remains deeply shrouded in mystery for the moment."
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.15.a:0 "Not a good sign for the future, certainly."

twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.16.t:0 "The National Trial of Traitors"
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.16.d:0 "The mood in the capital today was one so electric it seemed the entire city itself and dozens of surrounding villages had all congregated to observe and participate in the event that was shaping up to become the largest gathering of a public crowd in memory. An eclectic bunch of demonstrators, some avid believers of premier Khruschev, some violent revolutionaries and even gatherings of "All-Russian People's Revolutionaries", a euphemistic title for fascist gangs united in hatred of the invader to the west, descended onto the capital, all to witness the people's trial of the century.\n\n"Lev Abramov, the Soviet people find you guilty of treason, collaboration with foreign imperialists and betrayal of our proud union to the fascists. There can be no fitting end to your disgraceful existence other than immediate death." To the other dozens of interned collaborators, each standing catatonically behind the accused man, this sentencing proved to be not surprising in the slightest, for all they could think of was how the vicious mob below them would sort out their end. No makeshift gallows could be seen in sight, and bullets were scarce, even to the police. Would their captors simply throw them headfirst into the crowd below to tear them to shreds?\n\n"Anatoly Polyakov, death." another verdict read, each time a thunderous cheer of ecstatic thousands rejoiced in the justice brought to another fascist turncoat. The remaining accused felt some respite in the announcement however, no more deliberation on "Fascist this, Fascist that, the court finds you guilty of blah blah blah blah blah." their fate would come sooner it seemed, and several were resigned in accepting it.\n\nThen as the last man stepped up to be convicted, an older looking man of roughly 50, he looked far more dejected than the rest of the bunch. Then he began to struggle, frantically picking his handcuffs, and a fight broke out on the podium. One of the prosecuting guards managed to find the upper hand, and kicked the man down into the swarming sea of bloodthirsty men below them. A limb, a streak of red and horrific screams were all that came out of that man before he finally fell silent. To the rest onlooking, they could now find that their untimely end at the hand of the crowd was perhaps not the case. Perhaps even they were to fit a cowardly but quick end through the pang of lead entering their skulls. Many of the traitors to Russia sighed to themselves and thought nothing of a potentially violent and slow death similar to their recently departed fellow collaborator."
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.16.a:0 "And then they brought out the pitchforks."

twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.17.t:0 "The Sociology of Reform"
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.17.d:0 "As part of [NOV.GetLeader]'s ambitious reform agenda, he seeks to change the Soviet state's relationship with society and nationality. Criticising the Great Russian Chauvinism of the Stalinist and post-Stalin era, he proposes reforms to SSRs, autonomous SSRs and other national subdivisions, as well as changes to the structure of the state and party as a whole, to promote better recognition of minority languages and ethnic groups within the USSR. To support these measures, he cites Lenin's support for the rights of Soviet nationalities and support for their autonomy.\n\nSuch reforms have of course run into opposition from within the party. Members of the 'realist' faction in particular oppose what they see as the allowing of bourgeois nationalism and the potential dividing up of the Soviet Union. [NOV.GetLeader] will have to tread carefully with such a touchy issue."
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.17.a:0 "We'll work it out."

twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.18.t:0 "Suslov's Rehabilitation"
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.18.d:0 "In a move widely condemned by Chernenko and his moderate wing, hardline ideologician and former Beria ally Mikhail Suslov has been reinstate as a member of the Communist Party. Although his former treachery was undoubtable, he has been given the "revolutionary job" of overseeing the re-sovietization of the Tatar region. This should be a job that he will both despise and do poorly in. Perhaps his exampe may serve as a lesson to other wannabe Stalinists as well."
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.18.a:0 "Have "fun" out there, Mikhail..."

twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.19.t:0 "The Economics of Reform"
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.19.d:0 "It is no secret that military defeat and years of German colonialism in the west has brought economic catastrophe to the USSR. Nor is it controversial within the Party that reforms must be put in place to get the economy back on track as part of a broader program of reconstruction. There is, however, debate about what form this economic recovery should take.\n\n[NOV.GetLeader] favours a back-to-basics program to focus economic resources on rebuilding traditional society. With a focus on revitalising the degraded urban areas of the USSR first, he seeks to bring prosperity primarily to traditional households, promoting both increased living standards, growth through consumption as well as rebuilding traditional family structures and therefore strengthening society.\n\nThis is supported by many in the realist faction, but the reformist idealists are opposed to this program, supporting economic policies being more broadly distributed across rural and urban areas, as well as a greater focus on uplifting individuals, particularly women. Whatever happens, the Party will have to come to some consensus on this issue to move forwards."
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.19.a:0 "We can work it out."

twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.20.d:0 "Premier Krushchev has officially ordained the creation of a new branch within the Soviet Army, the Red Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nAfter taking inspiration from the American US Army Corps of Engineers,  several generals and planners have begun the task of creating a whole new service under the Soviet Army. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is a multitool for all things constructing, maintaining, developing, and destroying for the United States Military. They've built Airbases, Munitions Depots, and Water Infrastructure across the world where the US has needed it. Not only a military organization, they also help improve civilian infrastructure at home and abroad.\n\nPremier Krushchev and General Kissov created the initial outline for the Soviet Army Corps of Engineers (SACE or IKSA from Cyrillic). The three chief goals of this force are the construction of military and civilian infrastructure, the maintaining of said infrastructure, and the demolition or refitting of infrastructure at home and abroad. So far the force contains 30,000 men and is split into six 5,000-men strong divisions stationed across the USSR.\n\nKissov has been assigned as the First Deputy Commander of the force, and General Ivan Mikhailovich Sergetov as the Commander-General above him."

We cannot drop the arms we have, we must fight against the enemies of the people, we are expected by the tortured people's of Russia, we shall liberate them!"

We have liberated the worker's of the Far East!\n\nAlready hundreds of Prisoners of War have been captured; the president's whereabouts are currently unknown, we theorize that he has taken a plane to Sakhalin, to then flee to the American West Coast.\n\nOur troops are marching triumphantly across the city's main avenues and streets, with hundreds of workers hailing them as their liberators! It isn't all games and fun, though, we must extend the government's reach to the city, we will assign a provisional military governor for Vladivostok, who will then slowly integrate it into our system."

The primary proposal, no doubt concoted by the famous Trofim Lysenko, has called for the transformation of Kazakhstan steppes into a new breadbasket of the Soviet Union.\n\nOn the other hand, many in the government believe that a shift towards scientific exploration, especially towards the final frontier of space would not only be a source of great prestige for the stupid people but would also put Russia back on the map as a global superpower. Sergei Korolev, the chief proponent of this proposal, certainly has the know-how and believes he can get the proper equipment to make this a reality."

Now, he and his supporters have set out his most ambitious plan yet, by far, known as the New Asian Lands Programme.\n\nCalling for the damming of the Darya river, the plan is enormous in scale and scope, envisaging a huge range of waterworks able to divert the river's waters in order to green Kazakhstan. According to Lysenko, vast areas of Central Asian desert could be irrigated and turned over to productive cultivation, mitigating food shortages and allowing the growing of cash crops for export.\n\nHydrological engineers have strongly questioned the plan, arguing that Lysenko's calculations are dubious and without better planning, the scheme could lead to possibly negative environmental consequences. Lysenko is, after all, a biologist rather than an engineer. The Politburo, however, has full confidence in Lysenko's activities, and has dismissed concerns as overcautious and pessimistic. The plan, despite opposition, has been given a quick go-ahead, and resources have been allocated for its completion."

The central Asian region has been historically neglected by Russian governments, stalling in both social and economic modernization.\n\nWe must change this situation if we want our socialist nation to advance wholly towards utopia. We are considering, among other things, the creation of several towns to bolster urbanisation in the entire region. This will make it easier for quality of life to rise up, together with industrialisation and, to an extent, social progress.\n\nThese towns will be allocated in strategic positions, close to industrial and mining centers, as well as the Aral Sea and the Balkhash lake. This will take up a good amount of materials, however, if handled properly, we will finally be able to develop Central Asia to a level on par with Central and Western Siberia."

While our historic circumstances have made us somewhat late to the party in this regard compared to other great powers, finally, through the great efforts of many eminent Soviet scientists and engineers, as well as inspiration from foreign rocket designs, we stand ready to make our first step into space.\n\nOur prototype rocket, a modified ballistic missile capable of launching small payloads into orbit, has completed tests and is ready for launch. Atop it the first Soviet satellite, a basic prototype model called 'Mechta' or 'Dream', sits ready to orbit the earth. Should everything go right, the Soviet Union will join the small club of spacefaring nations."

twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.28.d:0 "All involved were well aware of the high risks involved in our first foray into space technology. While the launch at first seemed nominal, the rocket's guidance system malfunctioned during its ascent. This caused severe oscillation and, while flying through the atmosphere at hypersonic speed, resulted in the rocket breaking up and the destruction of Mechta. Surviving debris was recovered downrange for analysis.\n\nOur first attempt has unfortunately been a failure, and we cannot yet claim to have joined the select group of spacefaring nations. This is only a temporary setback, however. Our scientists and engineers continue to innovate, and we will very soon succeed where today we have failed."

A decorated and skilled pilot of the Great Patriotic War, Gagarin was chosen personally by [NOV.GetLeader] among a pool of potential highly qualified cosmonauts to be the first candidate.

Ever since the days of their conquest under the Imperial boot they had been continually marginalized and exploited by the hands of capitalism, imperialism and revisionism. Under the social imperialists in Vladivostok, this has not changed in spite of their claims to the contrary.\n\nAs we gear up for the final war of reunification, we can not only strike a deal that will make the lives of the Yakuts easier but also deal a crippling blow to our eastern enemies in the conflict to come. By promising autonomous status to the Yakuts in exchange for organizing an armed uprising, we just might be able to turn the tides of the war. This is a risky move however, as it may wind up in their complete destruction."

twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.33.t:0 "Lysenkoism Introduced To The Steppes"
twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.33.d:0 "Lysenkoism, so named after it's chief proponent, Trofim Lysenko, is without question the epitome of Soviet science. A theory that has advanced agriculture as much as it has the cause of Communism, it is a rejection of the ideas of natural selection and geneticism, both Western, thus bourgeois, and thus Capitalist principles that continue to hold back progress in the field of biology for nearly a century now. But the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics lacks that which holds so many nations back: The notion that we must be chained to tradition and the past. In accordance with this principle of doing away with such outdated views, Lysenko's research has culminated into Lysenkoism, a theory that, once acted upon, will no doubt lead to drastic increases in crop production.\n\nThough Lysenkoism was previously adopted across the entire union and enjoyed mainstream support from even the General Secretary himself, the industrial hemp ordeal, however, led to the disappearance of most of Lysenko's support amongst the Party. Arguing that continued implementation of his findings would lead to a now substantially weakened union becoming ‘dizzy with success' once again, for years, they have advocated for more traditional methods of agricultural development until it once again became feasible to accept such a risk. [NOV.GetLeader] has now, at last, declared that such a time has come.\n\nThough Lysenkoism has faced significant criticism in the past, leading to defiance and refusal from even our own Party members to implement the necessary steps to bring the Union into the future, we believe we have found a way to silence such slander once and for all: A smaller scale implementation of Lysenkoism on the more arable regions of central Asia will no doubt bring levels of success that not even the most reactionary of critics could deny. Once Kazakhstan enjoys all the blessings that Lysenkoism can offer to it, there will be nothing stopping us from implementing it across the entire Union once again, and reaping all that we deserve from our dedication to defending such brilliance!"

twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.34.d:0 "The results of our earlier implementation of Lysenkoist Agricultural Theories on the lands of Central Asia have finally arrived: To the surprise of no one but the now cowed disbelievers, the program was a massive success! Crop yields are reported to have grown in some regions over 50%, but even that could not accurately describe the scale of our success: According to our reports, by creating such high-quality crops through the rejection of Mendelian inheritance theories, Lysenkoism has given rise to various 'Super Crops,' so rich in both calories and nutrition that a single meal consisting of them can account for several of the same composed of ordinary crops. It is truly every agriculturalist's dream: We have greater excess than ever, and yet, require a mere fraction of what we produce!\n\nOf course, there have been reports of some minor setbacks: Data points that serves as mere outliers compared to the grand success of the rest of the project. Crop yields shrinking rapidly rather than growing, and in some cases, even famines breaking out due to a lack of food. However, the Party has rightfully noted that these statistics were all reported by noted critics of Lysenko's work. In other words, no mere coincidence, but instead, yet another attempt to discredit his work, most likely spiteful over being proven wrong time and time again.\n\nSome have even gone so far as to accuse Trofim and those who were responsible from collecting data from the more successful regions of the program of submitting misleading information in the name of maintaining the credibility of his theories. Serious as these accusations may be, we, of course, know the truth: As Lysenko himself has rightfully pointed out, falsifying data for the sake of personal gain is a uniquely capitalist phenomena, one that the universal equality of our communist paradise makes unfeasible by design. Furthermore, distorting scientific realities for the sake of obtaining politically desirable outcomes is the exact kind of thinking that led to the mainstream adoption of Lamarckian and Mendelian inheritance theories in the first place, falsehoods that demanded the creation of a new, Soviet model in place of both. That model, of course, has been refined down to Lysenkoism. With such assurances behind these incredible results, there is no more room for doubt: The Party has seen fit to adopt Lysenko's work as official party doctrine!"

"Our motherland is proud to see her children, be they factory workers, doctors, teachers, soldiers or farmers, collectively paving the road towards a better future united in comradeship and socialist unity.." The speech went on, a very positive message for the people of Zhdanovgrad, though it seemed somewhat generic. The premier proceeded to talk about the man the city was renamed after, premier Andrei Zhdanov.\n\n"There are no perfect men in this world, Comrade Zhdanov, may he rest in peace, was an imperfect man. Despite this, it is undeniable that Comrade Zhdanov contributed not only to the Socialist revolutionary cause, but also made his contribution to World History, and may we remember him that way, not as a political figure, but a historical character whose name will echo through the world for decades to come"\n\nMassive rounds of applause followed, the premier saluted the crowds with a confident smile on his face, and the people of Zhdanovgrad seemed to be happy to work on the road towards the worker's paradise."

Attacking with the element of surprise, they have killed and robbed a number of farmers, and even attacked isolated border posts when they saw the chance.\n\nWhile in truth the damage has been relatively minor so far, this attack provides an opportunity. It is a clear pretext for retaliation, and a reason to motivate the nation to war to retake Turkestan.

Our high command has decided to take a preemptive measure against this issue, and is currently debating on a military intervention against one of two possible regimes that could pose a threat to us: Afghanistan and Iran.\n\nOur generals held debates and arguments almost the entire last month, pointing and scribbling at maps, making simulations, and so on. After much meditating, the high command has decided on a preemptive strike against the nation of Iran. It's very simple, the Persian country is one of the biggest oil suppliers of the Reich, it's ardently pro-Germany and fascistic, and it leaves Central Asia open for funding of separatists and terrorists in the region.\n\nThe operation will remain top-secret for now, it will take a few weeks for it to be fully ready."

Millions are dead, whole towns have wiped off the face of the earth, cities are in total disrepair, and all economic resources have been looted or destroyed by the retreating Germans. The land is dead, stripped bare with farms as far as the eye can see destroyed to deprive the population of food.\n\nIt is clear that if [NOV.GetLeader] is to restore the USSR to its former glory and then continue to rejuvenate it as he plans, the western regions will have to be rebuilt from the damage that the German barbarians have done to it. A long and costly program of reconstruction will have to be organised before the economic resources of the Soviet Union are restored and greater things can be achieved."

It is also worth noting that Soviet partisans in their time of occupying major cities also built or refurbished rudamentary industry of their own in the anti-fascist struggles of 1953. While we could continue where the partisans left off, it may be more reliable and better in the long run to simply renovate the old nazi factories and go from there."

twrnovosibirskkhrushchev.42.d:0 "As the Central Committee of the Politburo looks at how to go about recovery efforts in the western territories, one fundamental issue is the demographic catastrophe that the Nazis left behind. Mass killing, deliberate starvation and demographic warfare driven by the hateful racial ideology of the Germans has left us with a demographic catastrophe, as those areas under German occupation have become severely depopulated. It is clear something must be done.\n\nThe realist faction sees a simple solution in resettling those territories that have undergone the most severe depopulation. Millions of refugees fled into the Ural regions and Siberia leading to population growth. Encouraging, or even forcing, those from the east to resettle in the more economically valuable territories of the west would fix things quickly.\n\nThe idealist faction prefers a more methodical and local solution. Opposing further mass displacement of people as potentially causing more problems than it solves, it proposes working in local regions for local people. In the west, incentives can be made for rebuilding families through having more children, and a wider array of people can be encouraged into the workforce through retraining initiatives to ease the demographic shortfall in the meantime.\n\nHow should the Politburo respond to this crisis?"

The trials the Soviet people have had to go through over the last few decades are some of the greatest suffered by any nation in history.

First under the leadership of Khrushchev, and then when he failed to live up to expectations, under Chernenko, the USSR has been reunified and its power grows every day as it rebuilds itself, like a phoenix rising from the ashes. The economy, driven by a massive program of infrastructure reconstruction and the innovation of our scientists and technicians, is growing rapidly, expanding the opportunities and living standards of a once destitute Soviet people. The Red Army, once battered in defeat, is rising again into a world-powerful fighting force, ready to defend the USSR from another invasion and fight wherever needed.\n\nThere is still much to be done if we are to catch up to the capitalist powers of the west, with their great economic head start and imperial advantage.

That said, however, the Politburo's rule has made a surprising success of readapting Khrushchev's overoptimistic plans, and we expect to close the gap with the richest capitalist states in good time.

Electricity is a luxury, so is running water; of the roads in Russia, only arround 500.000 km are paved, with the rest still being dirt roads.\n\nIn the last years, a rampant drug-addiction problem has arisen in the country, with hundreds of thousands of young men succumbing to the vice of Marijuana. Furthermore, with the government making so little efforts to stop drug trade, the Soviet Union has become a safeheaven for production of "grass", hundreds of clandestine workshops are working inside of Siberia. Neighbouring countries are already reporting issues with trafficking from soviet cartels.\n\nLysenko's agricultural programs, based on ideologically driven pseudo-science, have caused enormous losses for the agrarian sector, resulting in the death of millions of crops. As of right now, the Soviet Union is massively importing wheat and other crops from America and Europe to avoid a famine from happening, this made the Soviet foreign debt increase greatly.\n\nAt the helm of this rotten carcass of a state is a man despised by most of the people of the USSR, his name is Nikita Sergeyevich Krushchev. After a repeated series of mismanagements and bad choices, Krushchev now is leading a corpse of a country, a country he killed with his policies. The premier's situation is also worrying, he has become increasingly reclusive, barely going into any public acts. His personality has grown much more erratic, he's started to obsess over what he deems as "ideological correctness", this behaviour in particular is not very different from that of people like Stalin or Mikhail Suslov.

Rejecting the growing global scientific consensus in favour of Mendelian genetics, Lysenko is a proponent of Lamarckism, a model by which living organisms can pass on physical characteristics through their use during their life, not just purely through their genes at birth.\n\nLysenko has been rising through the ranks of our genetics and agriculture scientific community, but his rise has sparked outrage among some of his fellow agronomists. With the backing of some high ranking party members, they have petitioned Voznesensky to demote Lysenko and reject his theories. Among his defenders within the party however, Lysenko is a scientific hero, and many within the party not only want to see him further promoted, but for Lysenkoism to be adopted throughout the party and government and inform our agricultural policy.\n\nWith this growing ideological split within the party over the role of Lysenkoism unable to solve itself, Voznesensky himself will have to choose which side to take."

twrnovosibirskvoznesensky.4.d:0 "All within the party are agreed that, as part of our program of 'Sovietification' of culture, Marxist theory must be well-integrated as a core part of our education system. A major part of this is Marxist Dialectic Materialism, which puts the material world as the basis of reality, and argues that ideas and beliefs can emerge only out of human experience of material conditions. This forms the basis of Marx and Engels' discoveries on the nature of history, and will surely be taught in all schools.\n\nHowever, there is disagreement within the party as to how far the teaching of Marxist dialectics should be expanded. Voznesensky and some of his advisors had planned to enforce the integration of this framework into all parts of education, ensuring that it is the only framework by which humanities and social sciences can be taught. Others, however, warn that enforcing too rigidly any ideological framework, even one as great as that of Marx and Engels, across all intellectual fields, even those it was not intended for, could make our education system too narrow and stifle innovation."

twrnovosibirskvoznesensky.5.d:0 "Ever since the collapse of the USSR to the Nazi invasion, the quality of healthcare has severely declined across Russia. Under our government, what healthcare is provided is almost all done through local communes, which have their own individual doctors, and often these doctors rise through the ranks to lead the health systems in their communes, not because of exceptional ability, but because of party loyalty and ideological zeal. This is, of course, useful in some ways - making sure that high ranking professionals within the community are committed communists and party loyalists helps ensure stability, but of course, such an un-meritocratic system is causing a drag on the quality of the already rudimentary healthcare system.\n\nVoznesensky is presented with a dilemma - leave the system how it is, with party loyalty being a major component that decides who is sent to be leading doctors in far-flung communes, or reform the system towards being entirely merit-based."

Strictly enforced new regulations on education, healthcare and other areas of society through rigid adherence to the Zhdanov doctrine is successful in maintaining the unity of society and the influence of the party, but is having clear detrimental effects on the effectiveness of these social programs.\n\nA full change of course would be politically costly and is something Voznesensky is fairly determined to avoid, but the strict emphasis on ideology and theory over practical considerations in recent Sovietification policy decisions has very clearly backfired."

In return for amnesty, and a high-ranking role in the new shared army and government, Voznesensky proposes that the two states unify under his nominal leadership to improve their chances of reunifying the Soviet Union.\n\nZhukov, of course, is not naive enough to trust Voznesensky immediately, and is hesitant to give up the independence of the Krasnoyarsk government and his power over it.

The Perm government in the west still claims to be the legitimate government of the entire Soviet Union and rejects any legitimacy of rival claimants such as ourselves. As we have risen in Siberia, war against Perm, and its substantial industrial base in the Ural region, is inevitable. It is only a matter of time before we must march west towards Perm, our next step on the way to reunifying the Russian and Soviet people.\n\nThis will likely be the toughest of our battles so far.

Of course, winning was only half of what we needed to do to reconstruct the nation properly, as the reintegration of these territories will require a significant investment on our behalf to ensure the process goes smoothly and without any further damage to national unity. In this, we have launched a massive purge of former government and military officials to ensure they are unable to undertake any kind of resistance to our government, with only mid-level officials who have been deemed as "loyal" being able to keep their positions and be assigned to posts relevant to the reconstruction effort. At the same time, Sovietification efforts are also to be expanded to the region, while investments will be made to repair the damages incurred during the war with the Perm Government for a hopefully prompt and swift recovery."

twrnovosibirskvoznesensky.13.d:0 "Unfortunately, not everybody appreciates the Sovietification efforts undertaken by Premier [NOV.GetLeader], as has recently been showcased in Omsk, which has been engulfed in a major wave of unrest following dissatisfaction with the government's policies. What began as a lock-in by factory workers across the city spiraled into a massive wave of protests, with citizens taking to the street across the city to express their anger over the Sovietification policies, occupying the city center, and forcing out city officials and police forces sent to contain the unrest. The situation escalated further after the police began to fire on the protestors after one threw a Molotov Cocktail into the police line, killing six, and triggered a surge in the crowd that overran the officers, killing most of them. As word spread about the massacre, more protestors confronted the police, thus enforcing a negative feedback loop of more shootings sparking further riots, with over two hundred police officers and protestors believed to have been killed. This eventually culminated in the police entirely withdrawing from the urban center due to a lack of riot control officers, leaving Omsk in a virtual state of anarchy.\n\nHowever, a lack of clear leadership and direction caused the mob to quickly devolve into a mass cavalcade of looting and violence, with many innocent bystanders being killed in the chaos. Now the mayor is requesting Premier [NOV.GetLeader] allocate additional forces from the NKVD to help in quelling the unrest gripping the city; however, some officials close to [NOV.GetLeader] caution that deploying the NKVD now may cause the mob to redirect its focus towards government forces, thus increasing casualties on our end. Instead, they insist on waiting on the rioters to burn themselves out, thus allowing the government to more easily retake control over the city with minimal casualties, though this would risk more civilians dying in the long term."

Unfortunately, despite everything regarding the address being scheduled and planned out beforehand, things still managed to go horribly wrong thanks to the Premier's chronic alcoholism.\n\nAlthough the exact rationale will never be fully understood, it appears that [NOV.GetLeader] forgot that he had scheduled the address for the evening and that by the time his aides came to get him for the speech, he had already begun drinking his nightly rounds of vodka. Despite being offered the chance to postpone the address until the next day, [NOV.GetLeader] insisted on proceeding, to which the staffers relented, thus beginning a rambling, incoherent speech to the public that will be remembered for all the wrong reasons. Although initially sticking to the script the best he could, it didn't take long for the Premier to soon ramble off-topic onto various issues that ranged from somewhat comprehensible to total insanity. Some of the highlights include: calling his secretary a cheating whore, saying that several of the current high-ranking Red Army commanders stabbed the USSR in the back and that they should be purged, alleging that Premier Beria once claimed some obscure foreign Queen in one of his acts of sexual predation, and claiming that citizens who oppose Sovietification are "completely retarded, and should be interned in mental institutes to die."\n\nAt this point, the aides decided to end the speech before the Premier could do any more damage, but not before the speech's dramatic end in which one of the staffers was punched by the Premier after attempting to take him away from the microphone. Naturally, the entire event has become a massive embarrassment for us, given that the people now think that their Premier is completely unhinged, an alcoholic, or both, with the government quickly taking steps to censor the speech's existence and refuse acknowledgment of the event as a form of damage control. Despite these efforts, though, there is only so much the censors can do to salvage the government's image, and no matter how much propaganda we put out, a sizeable portion of our population will now only know Premier [NOV.GetLeader] as a rambling drunkard leading the USSR on the road to nowhere."

twrnovosibirskvoznesensky.15.d:0 "While the incorporation of Perm and those areas associated with it into his domain had been a great victory, certainly deserving of all the celebration it had been receiving, [NOV.GetLeader] was now left with a choice, and far from an easy one. The old Perm politburo, now functioning as a part of his Soviet state, remained fiercely divided and factionalized even now that it was supposedly subordinate to him. The only effective way to end this factionalism and infighting would be to side with one of the largest factions and guide it to victory- but which one? There was the Komsomol and its supporters, young Soviets who possessed great mass power even if they might be called unreliable much of the time; Beria and his NKVD backers, whose support would greatly benefit security operations and internal stability even if relying on them had historically had unpleasant consequences; and finally, Suslov and his anti-revisionists, backed by ideological firebrands and much of the political elite alike, although they could be too independent-minded at times for Voznesensky's liking. This choice would have consequences not only for his consolidation of power, but for the very future of his Soviet Union, and as such [NOV.GetLeader] knew he had to choose wisely."

twrnovosibirskvoznesensky.16.d:0 "Ever since the collapse of the Union to the Nazi invasion and Stalin's fall from power, the party has splintered and misguided members have, wrongly blaming the defeat on our state ideology, adopted non-orthodox visions of socialism. While until now our government was too weak to reassert control without the help of those who do not follow Marxist orthodoxy, with [NOV.GetLeader]'s grip on power ever tightening, the time has come to remove these revisionist elements. As Stalin did before us, we must ruthlessly hunt down and destroy counter-revolutionary elements within our party itself. Ideologically revisionist officials across all levels of the party will be found and removed from the picture.\n\nAdditionally, Mikhail Suslov is gaining too much power, and is a potential threat to [NOV.GetLeader]'s rule and the stability of the state. While it is not so easy to move against him so directly, the purging of the revisionists provides the perfect cover for Suslov to be quietly exiled and forced out from any position of power."

In proceedings watched and managed intently by [NOV.GetLeader] himself, Bulganin, a committed Bolshevik since the 1917 revolution and committed Stalinist through the 30s and 40s, was accused of the crime of revisionism, as well as trumped up charges of treason by aiding foreign powers. In the old Stalinist way, intense and cruel interrogations brought forth confessions, and from that point, the verdict was already set in stone.\n\nWith Bulganin formally found guilty, [NOV.GetLeader] can breathe a sigh of relief as another rival is pushed out of the picture. For Bulganin himself, only the firing squad now awaits."

twrnovosibirskvoznesensky.18.d:0 "Despite reunification having taken place a few weeks ago, a formal celebration the government to commemorate the occasion was yet to be organized, regardless of the street festivities that came about when the announcement was made. No, this celebration would be for the Communist Party, consisting of high-ranking party members from the Central Committee, Secretariat, Orgburo, and Politburo with other People's Commissars and Premier Voznesensky attending given their de facto status as party leader. Unfortunately, none of them would remember this party for any memories made in the commemoration and celebration of the hard work they'd all put in to reforge the USSR, but rather for the tragic and untimely death of its organizer during its course.\n\nDuring the party, Premier Voznesensky, for reasons unknown, although he was already intoxicated, decided to perform a party trick that had him consume ten 250ml shots of vodka that had 60% alcohol content in rapid succession. Naturally, this caused great concern among the partygoers who had him taken out of the room to seek medical treatment to hopefully, at the very least, minimize the damage caused by such a stunt. He didn't make it, as he blacked out roughly twenty minutes after the trick and was declared dead by morning, with the autopsy revealing a blood alcohol level of 2.08%. With his death, First Deputy Chairman Georgy Popov has assumed the duties of the Premiership until a permanent replacement can be found, with the various party factions readying themselves for the ensuing power struggle.\n\nThough many are openly expressing remorse and sadness for the death of the man who's rebuilt Russia, in truth, many are secretly relieved at the man's passing. Voznesensky's alcoholism, policy failings, and public blunders had alienated large portions of the party, with even those in his support base beginning to distance themselves from him in the hopes of shifting the blame entirely onto him, to give their faction a new face in a potential party coup. The only reason it had yet to happen was out of fears that it'd disrupt the reunification process, but now that the Premier is dead, it thankfully seems that there will be a slightly more peaceful transfer of power. As he leaves this world, Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky leaves behind a legacy of blood, alcohol, and despair, who, through brute force, managed to cleave Russia back together, forcing upon it his Sovietification and the failures that it brought in its wake. If not for reunification, the party and the history it writes would've purged him years ago."

Although his contributions to light industry cannot be discounted, and are in fact a great boon to the economy, his establishment of a private business world and capitalist landowning class were betrayals, accidental or otherwise, of the great Soviet experiment. Any proper understanding of Marx and Lenin shows that these steps were not only dangerous, they were unnecessary and in the long run detrimental. We shall reverse these 'Bukharinist' policies immediately and rectify this mistake, forcing out by ultimatum when possible and wiping out by force when necessary these would-be capitalists, so that we can restore the economy to what was intended by Marx, and return to the road towards international socialist prosperity."

Igor did as ordered, he hung his brown wool coat on a racket, already noticing the delicious smell that came from the table. "What's that sound?" Igor asked, a noise that came from the corner, like someone speaking in a somewhat muffled voice. "It's...the television set, our neighbor got a similar one, just today."

novflavour.2.t:0 "The Lysenko Proposal"
novflavour.2.d:0 "Renowned geneticist and pioneer in the sphere of soviet agriculture, Trofim Lysenko, arrived before the central committee this morning with another radical proposal for the politburo. Due to the conditions of Central Siberia recently offering stewardship of vast types of grains, foodstuffs and medicinal plants, Lysenko has once again proven his innovativeness with his plan to interbreed these fostering lands with another crop that has long since been a part of Central Russia's "informal economy."\n\nCannabis, a drug long cultivated by Central Asian underground markets, is what Lysenko proposes to utilise in transforming the agricultural priorities of Central Siberia. Industrial Hemp, along with its widespread utility in creating fabrics, textiles and medicines, Lysenko argues will both foster Primary and Secondary industries simultaneously, and allow for the distribution and export of manufacturing and services at a rate faster than all of our neighbours. Lysenko deliberated in front of the committee for little under an hour, emphasizing the effect this endeavour could bring for the Soviet people, long held sway by the illegal drug trade's dominance. The adoption of wide scale Industrial Hemp Cultivation will serve as a positive externality for citizens of the Soviet, as the supply of medicinal cannabis will outpace the underground system, eliminating part of the illegal rings which currently plague Russia.\n\nLysenko's proposal was on paper a decision that was to pass the vetting of the Soviet before implementation, but in reality, Lysenko holds too much sway in the sphere of Soviet science to allow for any officials to object. Listening silently, the apparatchiks felt a sense that this decision could irreparably harm the Soviet, and a resurgence in counterrevolutionary thought onset by a rapidly increasing drug trade, but their thoughts held no power. At the end, they approved Lysenko's bid, offering large scale funding for hemp plantations to be constructed and operated away from civilian jurisdiction. In their smiles the men of the committee praised Comrade Lysenko, but in their eyes a morbid taste of the potential mass degeneration of Soviet life was an inescapable thought."

novflavour.3.d:0 "Since the vanquishing of the Reactionary Marshal's fiefdom and the abominations of the Norilsk GULAGs, our grip on Central Siberia has gradually laxed as the population finds itself more and more content with our benevolent rule as the legitimate successors to Marx and Lenin. In particular note is the population's enthusiastic reaction to our campaigns to expand the civilian agriculture sector to new heights, however the reasons for this new trend is allegedly due to the spectre of Lysenko's deeds.\n\nAlongside the expected batches of wheat, maize and other new grains freshly reaped from the tundra soil, our officials are becoming aware of civilians mixing their traditional production of grains with Lysenko's Hemp. Such an activity is hardly a far cry from the traditional cultivation of land across Russia, as was expected. Civilian participation in hemp production was stated by Lysenko to become an eventual certainty once the fruits of the original state batches were shown. However, what Lysenko and his Cronies in Novosibirsk are unaware of, this hemp surge is not the result of any kind of economic incentive.\n\nBased on several commissar reports for the regions of Krasnoyarsk, Tomsk, Norilsk and Altai, an increasing number of peasant farms and in some cases even the Kolkhoz settlements are experiencing workers and in particular, the youth, indulging in the industrial hemp grown freely by our own tillers. Pouring over the budgets, an increasing number of crop harvests are reporting lower and lower yields as the seasons go on. Frequent arrests of civilians on disorder charges are being made showing symptoms of Hemp abuse.\n\nSpeculations are sprouting in the day to day conversations within the central committee, as leaks pour in concerning the ever increasing number of abuse of the state crop. Some argue this epidemic is part of an unexpected expansion of the underground drug trade, while on the ground, Commissars are reporting that the reason behind this mass youth use is done out of a drive to escape the pathetic warring nature of our Union."

However the mistakes of our time in Novosibirsk haunt us still, and in particular the disastrous remnants of Lysenko's hemp initiative continues to plague our Union, rotting our youth from the inside out.\n\nIn Kazakhstan the virgin soil is tilled to produce some of the most fertile farmland in the world. Russian grain and American inspired maize is seeing production jump significantly, as the remnants of the old Siberian taiga farms have been swept away. However undermining our administrative hold of the Kazakh steppe is rampant corruption, stemming from the illegal distribution of narcotics throughout Russia. Local government officials are taking bribes from illegal gangs of Cannabis traders, seeking to rip as much value out of the Kazakh soil as they can to fuel the multi million dollar underground market.\n\nOf particular note is the lack of patrols in Kazakhstan, logistics find themselves unable to bear the administrative strain placed on effectively stopping these illegal farmers, and NKVD operatives find investigating leads on potential underground warehouses increasingly difficult. Everything we pour into stopping the trade seems to be swallowed up by the vast steppe. Furthermore, the agricultural prosperity of the region is proving so much of a cash return, many officials actively dissuade investigations of illegal drug networks, Lysenko himself amongst them, having turned back on his original claims, stating that he is practicing true communism by providing medicinal aid to the peoples of Russia.\n\nAs more and more dejected youths pile into overnight municipal cells, and already new strains of hemp carrying more and more THC content are becoming available, a genuine response to this crisis becomes harder and harder to find. Resources the central government provides turn up missing upon arrival, and police officers accept larger and larger bribes. Lamarck was correct, but his core tenants have become corrupt by the new Soviet Cannabis epidemic."

This culminated with the USSR Chess Championship, organized by the USSR Chess Federation, which displayed the brilliance of our best players to both our nation and the world. However, since the Nazi invasion and seizing of the heart of our homeland, the Party has had far more pressing matters to attend to than organizing any such tournaments, and the organization and the tournament were both abolished for years. Attempts by the civilian population to organize local competitions in our place have all failed through lack of funding, players, or both. With a recent regaining of strength and finances, however, the Union is officially in a stable enough position to reignite the competitive spirit of the Soviet people!\n\nBeing the first tournament held since 1941's Absolute Championship of the Soviet Union, the officially restored 1952 USSR Chess Championshp, organized by the Soviet Chess Federation-the official successor to the USSR Chess Federation, and one that is no longer aligned with the now Nazi controlled World Chess Federation-was held between the 12th of November and 12th of December, and was dedicated to the memory of Mikhail Botvinnik, the winner of the 1941 tournament, and thus our nation's official greatest player, who sadly perished during the Great Patriotic War. Ultimately, Mark Taimanov defeated Efim Geller to claim the title of champion in a stunning match, while 15 year old Boris Spassky impressed the world by finishing in sixth despite his age...Though his participation was seen by some as a farce, a visible sign of how low the quality of our players had dropped if a mere child could advance so far. Regardless, the event was a massive success, generating cheering crowds who already cannot wait for next year's tournament. In the meantime, they have taken to forming spontaneous chess clubs across the Union, in schools, factories, and even army units!"

Tens of tables filled in the hall, each with their own little duel and a small audience. Soon enough, the triumphant yells of "checkmate!" Could be heard all over the room. As the tournament progressed, fewer participants remained; eventually, by the late evening, the finals had commenced.\n\nTwo of the most famous chess masters of Russia were facing each other for the winning title. On one side, Mikhail Botvinnik, on the other, Vasily Smyslov. The last match took almost 2 hours, over 70 moves, until finally, at 9:54 pm, Botvinnik's bishop knocked over Smyslov's king, making him the winner of the 1° All-Soviet National Chess Tournament.

Hundreds of players from different continents battled each other over white and black pieces of wood.

Yegor Ligachyov wondered. Ever since  Voznesensky's rise to power, he had risen rapidly through the ranks as head of the so-called "Apathist" wing of the party. Now, it seemed as though he could turn a crowd of rowdy apparatchiks against their chairman and get what he always wanted.\n\n"G-good afternoon comrades!" Voznesensky exclaimed, stumbling into the room clearly drunk. It wasn't even 9 in the morning and he already had too much to drink, now was the time to act. As soon as the meeting began, a vote was held to remove the drunken chairman from office and replace him with the more sober and resolute Yegor Ligachyov, both of which passed near instantaneously. As the drunken and deposed Voznesensky was carried out of the room, Yegor sat in the chairman's seat to much applause. He quickly hushed the politburo, and went right back to business."

 POLITICS_ZHDANOV_DESC:0 "General Secretary Andrei Zhdanov was born on February 26th, 1896, into a family of Educational workers in Ukraine. Originally studying at a commercial institute for business, Zhdanov found himself drafted into the Imperial Army in WWI, and later joined the Red Army during the civil war as a commissar. After the war, Zhdanov held a series of civilian positions within the party until he found his way into the Politburo in the 1930s. Largely sidelined by Lavrentiy during the Great Patriotic War, Zhdanov took this as a personal affront, one he did not forget.\n\nOnce Lavrentiy Beria became premier in the USSR and began his purges, Zhdanov and any other officials afraid of Beria fled to Siberia, where they formed the Soviet Republic of Novosibirsk. However, this young soviet republic was unstable and found itself split when Georgy Zhukov and his forces fled to Krasnoyarsk. Since then, Zhdanov's health has continued to decline, and his grip on the party has as well, with his protege Voznesensky and Khrushchev constantly draining his already strained mental resolve. Now he is but a puppet of the party, clinging to life and a bottle of vodka with his final breaths."
 POLITICS_SCHERBAKOV_DESC:0 "A dedicated Bolshevik from an early age, Aleksandr Scherbakov joined the Red Guard in 1917 when he was only sixteen years old. Studying as an administrator after the war, he quickly rose through the ranks of the Communist Party as Stalin's purges kicked into overdrive. Finding work with Zhdanov in 1936, the two quickly became close friends. As the USSR suffered defeat after defeat at the hands of the advancing Germans, Shcherbakov's worst nightmare became a reality as his beloved Stalin mysteriously disappeared and the despised Beria took the reigns in his absence. Fleeing east to escape the wrath of the NKVD, Scherbakov became known by many in the Novosibirsk government as an obese and boisterous drunkard. Shcherbakov's leadership has become even more loose and incompetent than that of his predecessor, As many ambitious party-men have wasted little time in maneuvering behind his back. As his health continues to decline and his grip on power slips away, his days are numbered at best."

This intelligence didn't go unnoticed as his future protege Andrei Zhdanov appointed him to run the GOSPLAN during the Great Patriotic War. As his beloved project came crashing down when the Germans pushed deeper into Soviet territory, Voznesensky was thrown completely off-guard when Beria took the reigns of the Soviet Union in Stalin's absence. Fleeing east to a new power base in Novosibirsk, Voznesensky's cunning power grab has finally paid off as his former proteges have both died in a pool of their own alcoholic decadence, leaving him as the sole leader of a vengeful state opposing everything that the revisionist forces in Perm represent."
 POLITICS_KHRUSHCHEV_DESC:0 "Born in Ukraine in 1894, Nikita Khrushchev joined the Bolsheviks in 1918, rising through the ranks of the party and gaining favour with Stalin. Initially supportive of Stalin's purges, through the late 1930s seeing loyal party officials being denounced, including himself, caused him to question the nature of Stalin's rule. His confidence in the Soviet government as it was, shaken by the misguided purges, was shattered by the utter failure of the Soviet forces at the hands of the invading Nazis, especially in the bloody defeat at Stalingrad where he was present. While he is still openly a loyal member of the Communist Party, he has gradually shifted his position away from the type of rule championed by Stalin, instead looking to a much more open version of socialism."

Formerly a loud, obnoxious figure, he has performed a complete reversal into a calm, level-headed man fond of sprinkling his speeches with youthful lingo. The people, rumour-spreaders as they are, have developed a variety of theories as to Khrushchev's change, with many pointing to comrade Trofim Denisovich's cannabis programme - or perhaps Nikita Sergeyevich's doctor prescribing such things to allay his dramatic outbursts.\n\nWhatever the case may be, the truth is that he is a changed man - a true representative of the people. He is calm when the people's rage simmers, and expresses values of peace and harmony, rather than the complete destruction of all who have betrayed the motherland. He calls for peace and love while others call for war and hate; truly, a man to guide our motherland!"
