 #### Description ####
 Vladimir_Dolgikh_desc:0 "In the anarchy of Zhukov's death, an unlikely savior emerged to end the chaos in the city of Krasnoyarsk. That man was Vladimir Dolgikh, who was born on December 5th, 1924, in the Yeniseysk governate of the USSR. He would enthusiastically support Socialism, becoming a Young Pioneer, and even joining the Red Army when the German-Soviet war began. It was here however, that his life began to worsen. Becoming a political Commissar, he would be injured on the front line multiple times, only to be sent back in due to manpower shortages among educated commissars. This began to alienate Vladimir, as the very idea he fought for was attempting to murder him time and time again. He would find himself in the 6th Guards Infantry Division when Kalinin came to a power, and he slowly began rising through the ranks of Commissars.\n\nAfter Beria came to power however, Dolgikh found himself fleeing east with the other Guard Divisions, his commanders supporting Marshall Zhukov and his faction in the Novosibirsk Troika. He found his faith in Socialism further weakened, as the Novosibirsk Government fractured yet again, and his division fled east with Zhukov, to Krasnoyarsk. However this was not the end of his struggles, as this government would also collapse due to the Death of Zhukov as a result of the Tuvan insurrection, finally shattering Vladimir's faith in Socialism as a whole. When the capital descended into Anarchy, and the guards fled to Malinovsky, Vladimir stayed and defended his new home. He quickly organized the only remaining red army units, with the help of the City police, and soon restored a semblance of order. He now rules a provisional government in the city, intent on protecting it from the grasping hands of delusional socialists, whom have yet to accept the failures of the USSR."

 KCS_The_Citys_Savior:0 "The City's Savior"
 KCS_The_Citys_Savior_desc:0 "The collapse brought a lot of damage to our entire country, but we managed to restore at least the bureaucratic layer that survived the fall of Krasnoyarsk. The professional political staff that meets our political goals will be of perfect importance because they know what kind of work must be done in this hopelessness to be able to regain what was lost slowly but surely until we bring Krasnoyarsk to the path of that old glory that we all knew."
 KCS_Red_Army_Defectors:0 "Red Army Defectors"
 KCS_Red_Army_Defectors_desc:0 "Realizing that the army that hired them betrayed them, many soldiers decided to cross the border and old traditions so they can fight for our army. This sudden but welcome influx of new soldiers and officers will create an army that will be able to fight gloriously when the time comes when we decide it is time to unify Krasnoyarsk!"
 KCS_The_Failures_Of_Socialism:0 "The Failures Of Socialism"
 KCS_The_Failures_Of_Socialism_desc:0 "Socialism has been the ultimate mistake, since its inception! He never brought us anything good, he just took lives to empty the empty factories that were built to catch up with the quota. We do not have enough people, nor efficient enough equipment to perform basic industrial tasks that would help us in further development, all thanks to socialism that brought us to our knees! Drastic actions will have to be carried out to repair the damage inflicted on our country!"

 KCS_And_There_Was_A_City_Upon_A_Red_Hill:0 "A City Upon a Red Hill"
 KCS_And_There_Was_A_City_Upon_A_Red_Hill_desc:0 "The days before the Great Patriotic War were the best of times; economic success, a Russia on the upswing, and a nation that was becoming more prominent on the world stage. But then came the worst of times; our defeat at the hands of the fascists, followed by a descent into warlordism after an American invasion. But the future is not a tale of two cities; it is a future in which Krasnoyarsk shall be a shining city on a hill."
 KCS_The_City_Shall_Be_Saved_By_His_Will:0 "The City Shall be Saved, by His Will"
 KCS_The_City_Shall_Be_Saved_By_His_Will_desc:0 "Vladimir Ivanovich is a man who is well-versed in the ways of politics, and will bring our nation forwards - from far behind the world's powers to the front of the pack. He shall save the city of Krasnoyarsk from the outside forces which seek to bring it down, and unite our shattered motherland under one banner!"
 KCS_The_LZK_One_Party_State:0 "The LZK One-Party State"
 KCS_The_LZK_One_Party_State_desc:0 "The practice of democracy, at least as it is known in the west, is not something we should look towards as an ideal model by any means. Constant bickering between vastly-opposing forces is something which will only polarise society and drive people apart, as they identify with organisation over nation. We must establish a one-party state."
 KCS_Disbanding_All_Socialist_Organizations:0 "Disbanding All Socialist Organizations"
 KCS_Disbanding_All_Socialist_Organizations_desc:0 "Socialism, despite its self-proclaimed goal of egalitarianism, has only served to make the people of Russia poorer. These organisations serve as a threat to civilised society, and must be removed from the equation. Let us formally declare all socialist organisations illegal, and see to it that they are dealt with properly."
 KCS_Rebuilding_The_Limping_State:0 "Rebuilding the Limping State"
 KCS_Rebuilding_The_Limping_State_desc:0 "Russia, currently, is not a country. She has been divided up between petty warlords and those seeking to establish themselves as the true heirs to the throne of the fallen motherland. But it shall be us who revive Russia in the end. We must strive for a united Russia, and to that end, we will seek to make it so."
 KCS_The_Death_Of_Siberian_Stalinism:0 "The Death of Siberian Stalinism"
 KCS_The_Death_Of_Siberian_Stalinism_desc:0 "Stalinism is an ideology with more holes than a slice of Swiss cheese. Promoting ethnonationalism, the ruination of the people, and socialism, it led us to the complete and total destruction of our motherland during and after the Great Patriotic War. Yet, there are still fools who seek to uphold it. Let's make sure that they are wiped out, and the Stalinist fools are sent back into the dustbin of history."
 KCS_From_Nothing_Siberias_Saviour_Has_Come:0 "From Nothing, Siberia's Savior has Come"
 KCS_From_Nothing_Siberias_Saviour_Has_Come_desc:0 "Though it seems like decades, it has not been long since the fall of Zhukov's regime. Vladimir Ivanovich and his allies stood up when few were willing to do so, and have come out victorious in the end, beating back those who threatened to destroy Russia. But the battle is going again, and there is much to be done. Let us roll up our sleeves, and get to work!"
 KCS_The_Siberian_Protection_Forces:0 "The Siberian Protection Forces"
 KCS_The_Siberian_Protection_Forces_desc:0 "In this world, there is much to protect the people of Russia from. Fascists, communists, Americans and other petty warlords all seek to harm the fabric of our very nation, taking as much as they can from the common folk and then having the gall to ask for more. But no longer shall this racket continue - we shall form a military force to protect Russia from external threats."
 KCS_The_True_Heirs_Of_Suvorov:0 "The True Heirs of Suvorov"
 KCS_The_True_Heirs_Of_Suvorov_desc:0 "Aleksandr Vasilyevich Suvorov was the last Generalissimo of the Russian Empire, as well as one of the greatest military commanders in history: He brought Napoleon to his knees following his attempted invasion of Russia. While, unfortunately, red commanders did not look to Aleksandr Vasilyevich's legacy during the Great Patriotic War, we shall not repeat their mistake; his legacy shall live on in our armed forces."
 KCS_More_Than_An_Mere_Army:0 "More Than a Mere Army"
 KCS_More_Than_An_Mere_Army_desc:0 "Our nation's armed forces is not just a military; it is the organisation which defends the people, protects the motherland, and shall reunite our nation. It is a home for thousands of Russians who have none to call their own. The army is the lifeblood of our new and modern Russia, and we shall see to it that it receives adequate attention."
 KCS_Emphasis_On_Decisive_Action:0 "Emphasis on Decisive Action"
 KCS_Emphasis_On_Decisive_Action_desc:0 ""
 KCS_The_Army_Corps_Of_Education:0 "The Army Corps of Education"
 KCS_The_Army_Corps_Of_Education_desc:0 "The army is home to many people who have not had the chance to receive a proper education - something we must seek to remedy if we wish to participate on the world stage as an equal nation. We must promote the education of our officers, and for that reason it is necessary for us to establish the Army Corps of Education."
 KCS_The_Krasnoyarsk_Millitary_Institute:0 "The Krasnoyarsk Military Institute"
 KCS_The_Krasnoyarsk_Millitary_Institute_desc:0 "We must see to it that there is a proper institute which can educate our people in the art of warfare. Something similar to America's West Point or China's Whampoa will be something which is ideal to us. We will establish it in Krasnoyarsk, the centre of the nation, and train those willing in the ways of battle."
 KCS_You_Protect_People_First_And_Foremost:0 "You Protect the People, First and Foremost"
 KCS_You_Protect_People_First_And_Foremost_desc:0 "The goal of our motherland's military should not primarily be offensive, as the imperialist forces of many global powers have become, but rather serve to be a force of self-defence. We must not enforce Russian interests upon others, but rather protect our interests - that is, our people and motherland - above all else."
 KCS_Any_Who_Lose_The_Sight_Of_That:0 "Any Who Lose Sight of That..."
 KCS_Any_Who_Lose_The_Sight_Of_That_desc:0 "...are doomed."
 KCS_Rebuilding_The_Vanished_Market:0 "Rebuilding the Vanished Market"
 KCS_Rebuilding_The_Vanished_Market_desc:0 "Russia has not been part of the global economy since the White era - an unfortunate thing, when one considers all the profits that could be made with Russia's numerous natural resources and factories. We must see to it that we once again join the world, becoming a part of the global economy and raking in the profits as we do so."
 KCS_The_Siberian_Reconstruction_Plan:0 "The Siberian Reconstruction Plan"
 KCS_The_Siberian_Reconstruction_Plan_desc:0 "With the western reaches of our motherland under fascist occupation, it is necessary for us to build up Siberia as the industrial centre of Russia. However, the destruction caused by our period of warlordism has destroyed what little industry existed in Siberia. Let us draft plans to not only rebuild Siberia, but to build back better."
 KCS_Ancestry_Based_Land_Privatization:0 "Ancestry-Based Land Privatization"
 KCS_Ancestry_Based_Land_Privatization_desc:0 "We must ensure that society is properly separated; that some people who have unreasonable outlooks on society do not corrupt other sectors. Therefore, we will privatise land based on whose family is more deserving of such land, and whose family is not. For example; some communists do not deserve it, but some hard-working Russians who had no involvement with the revolution shall be granted what they deserve."
 KCS_The_Siberian_Recontruction_Project:0 "The Siberian Reconstruction Project"
 KCS_The_Siberian_Recontruction_Project_desc:0 "Now, the time has come to put our plans into practice. The reconstruction of Siberia from its destroyed, agrarian state into an industrial powerhouse of the world must begin. The massive forests which cover a land larger than China shall be erased, and the land will become a massive factory - for the future of the Russian economy and nation!"
 KCS_Rebuilding_Our_Shattered_Roads:0 "Rebuilding Our Shattered Roads"
 KCS_Rebuilding_Our_Shattered_Roads_desc:0 "Roads serve as one of the primary means by which people move around the country, but with the warlord period, many of these were destroyed or fell into disrepair. This is unacceptable for the modern nation we seek to be, and we must remedy this immediately - we must get to work on modern roads for a modern Russia."
 KCS_Immediate_Urban_Privatization:0 "Immediate Urban Privatization"
 KCS_Immediate_Urban_Privatization_desc:0 "While socialism is a great issue, to go around willy-nilly privatising the nation is no good, and will inevitably cause issues. We must, of course, take it upon ourselves to privatise urban areas, but not to any great extent; after all, these are areas where there needs to be some level of protection, and not simply left to private individuals."
 KCS_Quantitative_Urban_Privatization:0 "Quantitative Urban Privatization"
 KCS_Quantitative_Urban_Privatization_desc:0 "While socialism is a great issue, to go around willy-nilly privatising the nation is no good, and will inevitably cause issues. We must, of course, take it upon ourselves to privatise urban areas, but not to any great extent; after all, these are areas where there needs to be some level of protection, and not simply left to private individuals."
 KCS_Dolgihks_Theory_Of_Capitalist_Transition:0 "Dolgikh's Theory of Capitalist Transition"
 KCS_Dolgihks_Theory_Of_Capitalist_Transition_desc:0 "Dear Vladimir Ivanovich has recently begun to push a theory of gradual transition from socialism to capitalism, in opposition to the so-called "shock therapy" of rapid transformation. In this method, we shall not suffer from the issues caused by rapid transition, while at the same time leaving socialism behind at the end of the day."
 KCS_Forming_A_State_Owned_Realty_Company:0 "Forming a State-Owned Realty Company"
 KCS_Forming_A_State_Owned_Realty_Company_desc:0 "If there is one thing that cannot be left to private companies, it is real estate. But this is not to state that people do not have the right to own private property - in fact, quite the contrary. In order to ensure that private corporations cannot abuse and exploit the people by charging ridiculous prices for homes, we shall take control, and sell houses to the people ourselves."
 KCS_Opening_The_Eastern_Border_To_Trade:0 "Opening the Eastern Border for Trade"
 KCS_Opening_The_Eastern_Border_To_Trade_desc:0 "One could perhaps say that Asia is the future of the global economy. American investment in East Asia has led to tremendous economic growth, and we have reason to predict that as the century marches on, Asia's role in global trade will only grow larger. So, let us get to the front of the proverbial line, and begin our connection to East Asian trade now. As the English-language proverb states, the early bird gets the worm."
 KCS_The_LZK_Has_Evolved:0 "The LZK has Evolved"
 KCS_The_LZK_Has_Evolved_desc:0 "The Krasnoyarsk Protection League has evolved from its humble origins. We are no longer a simple, minor organisation of anti-communist figures, but rather a representation of the people's government. We must seek to emphasise the role of the league in the future, as we assert control over more and more of the motherland."
 KCS_Into_Something_Far_Greater:0 "Into Something Far Greater"
 KCS_Into_Something_Far_Greater_desc:0 "We are no longer an organisation simply for the city of Krasnoyarsk and its surrounding areas. Rather, we are an all-Russian organisation - one which must reflect the ultimate wills and desires of the Russian people. We must seek to build a government which will be greater for the whole motherland. Glory to Russia, and glory to her heroes!"
 KCS_Technocratic_Political_Appointments:0 "Technocratic Political Appointments"
 KCS_Technocratic_Political_Appointments_desc:0 "We must make appointments to political offices with the interests of technological advancement in mind. After all, with the technological setbacks we have suffered over the course of more than a decade (and excluding the numerous interruptions to technology caused by the purges of intellectuals under Stalin), we have some catching up to do."
 KCS_Intraparty_Democracy_Concept:0 "Intraparty Democracy Concept"
 KCS_Intraparty_Democracy_Concept_desc:0 "While a multi-party system is, of course, inherently going to lead to fracturing of society and polarisation, we must not overlook the concept of party democracy; that is, rule by consensus of party members. In this method, we shall avoid the polarisation and factionalisation associated with politics, while avoiding one-man rule."
 KCS_Standardized_Tests_For_Public_Offices:0 "Standardized Tests for Public Office"
 KCS_Standardized_Tests_For_Public_Offices_desc:0 ""
 KCS_The_Cult_Of_Higher_Education:0 "The Cult of Higher Education"
 KCS_The_Cult_Of_Higher_Education_desc:0 "To be well-educated is nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, it is the highest thing one can strive towards in life, far beyond any political or economic achievement. The uneducated, likewise, should not be holding any positions in society - for the blind should not lead the blind. We must therefore promote the supremacy of higher education, both for our leadership and the masses."
 KCS_Enfornce_Compliance_With_SZK_Doctrine:0 "Enforce Compliance with SZK Doctrine"
 KCS_Enfornce_Compliance_With_SZK_Doctrine_desc:0 "It is necessary for us to maintain a strong united front in the face of everything against us; the communists, the American puppets, and the fascists. We cannot allow petty squabbles and minor disputes to define us to the public, and we will not allow such things to happen. The Russian government is one."
 KCS_The_Formation_Of_The_Cliques:0 "The Formation of the Cliques"
 KCS_The_Formation_Of_The_Cliques_desc:0 "As with many other one-party states, we have begun to see the creation of informal cliques within the party. However, this is a good and natural thing, and a true expression of rule by consensus; after all, within any society, there are groups and organisations, both formal and informal. We shall permit these cliques, so long as our ability to come to a consensus is not significantly hindered."
 KCS_Declaring_Socialism_Unconstitutional:0 "Declaring Socialism Unconstitutional"
 KCS_Declaring_Socialism_Unconstitutional_desc:0 "Socialism is a threat to the very livelihoods of the Russian people, but more importantly, it is a threat to the constitutional order upon which our nation stands. To this end, we must see to it that socialism is declared unconstitutional, and can no longer play a role in threatening our brave motherland."
 KCS_The_Red_Horizon_Calls:0 "The Red Horizon Calls"
 KCS_The_Red_Horizon_Calls_desc:0 "We must now turn our eyes westwards, to the Perm Soviet Government. Those who brought us to ruin in the Great Patriotic War, they have managed to live on, and seek to bring all of the motherland under their banner once again. This is unacceptable, and we must stop them, no matter the costs. Russia shall be ours, and ours alone!"
 KCS_Prepare_For_The_Onslaught:0 "Prepare for the Onslaught"
 KCS_Prepare_For_The_Onslaught_desc:0 "There are enemies to our left, and enemies to our right. We are surrounded in this world, and we know it fully well. It is necessary for us to prepare for war on both fronts - and not only that, we must be prepared to win. We shall begin a rapid build-up and mobilisation of our armed forces, so that we will be ready when that day comes."
 KCS_The_Last_Vestige_Of_Communism_Ended:0 "The Last Vestige of Communism Ends"
 KCS_The_Last_Vestige_Of_Communism_Ended_desc:0 "We have proven ourselves successful, and taken down the red beasts to the west. Now, communism is no more in Russia, and it is a good riddance to us that this disgusting ideology shall no longer touch our lands. However, this is not the end of our struggle to reunify our country..."

 KCS_I_Will_Shed_No_Tears_For_Foreign_Puppets_desc:0 "The Russian "Republic" is, in truth, little more than a vehicle for foreign nations, such as the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, to force their will upon the Russian people. Such a thing shall not and cannot stand - we must take on this derelict successor to the White armies of old. But they will not go peacefully, and we must be prepared to fight them to the sea, if necessary."

We must support the mobilisation of our forces for an immediate advance upon the occupied territories of the Far East, and march to the coast - for freedom!"
 KCS_Russia_My_Love_You_Have_Returned:0 "Russia My Love, You Have Returned"
 KCS_Russia_My_Love_You_Have_Returned_desc:0 "At long last, the lands of Russia have all been united under one leader - Vladimir Ivanovich Dolgikh. No longer is Russia divided between various warring states, each claiming to be the true heir to the nation. Now, there is but one state - ours. Now, the time has come to build firm foundations, so that our state may weather the decades and centuries to come."
 KCS_The_Vodka_Doctrine:0 "The Vodka Doctrine"
 KCS_The_Vodka_Doctrine_desc:0 "It is necessary for the interests of the Russian motherland to be protected from harm. That much is something agreeable upon by many, but in this day and age, it seems that there are more nations breathing down our backs than ever before. It is for the best that we do not make any enemies; let us pursue diplomacy with the nations of the world."
 KCS_Formation_Of_The_Neutral_Protection_Bloc:0 "Formation of the Neutral Movement"
 KCS_Formation_Of_The_Neutral_Protection_Bloc_desc:0 "To say that we have no choice but to side with China or America in this world is not only a vast oversimplification, but wrong; we do not need to be aligned with either party, which only seeks the promotion of their interests. Rather, we must support neutrality, and the protection of our national interests alone."
 KCS_Our_Brothers_In_Blood:0 "Our Brothers in Blood"
 KCS_Our_Brothers_In_Blood_desc:0 "Who cannot say that we must be concerned with the affairs of our fellow Slavs - our brothers by blood relation? They are residents of the same nation as us, are our comrades in struggle against the fascist enemy. We must support the betterment of our ties to them, as well as improving our standing in the world."
 KCS_Returning_Pan_Slavism_For_The_Modern_World:0 "Pan-Slavism for the Modern World"
 KCS_Returning_Pan_Slavism_For_The_Modern_World_desc:0 "Pan-Slavism is the very foundation upon which our modern Russia - and the modern Slavic world - is built upon. But in these days, Pan-Slavism is more necessary than ever. We must not leave it by the wayside, but rather build upon it, and promote unity of the Slavic peoples in the face of fascist aggression."
 KCS_Our_Brothers_In_Spirit:0 "Our Brothers in Spirit"
 KCS_Our_Brothers_In_Spirit_desc:0 "The nation of Iran, while not a Slavic nation, has interacted with Russia countless times throughout history. We have looked towards each other for one reason or another during the Empire, the short-lived Republic, and the Soviet Union. And now, it is time for us to look towards another once more. Let us move closer together, as brothers from another mother."
 KCS_The_Cessation_Of_Tuva:0 "Our Friends in Nanjing"
 KCS_The_Cessation_Of_Tuva_desc:0 "The Republic of China is a country which has had its ups and downs with Russia, but the truth is that we Russians have more in common with the Chinese than we do different.

 KCS_An_Envoy_To_Seoul_desc:0 "Korea is a nation which has the opportunity of being a great friend to the Russian nation and people. We are both nations which are opposed to fascism, and trapped between a rock and a hard place - the Toronto Accords and China. As we both seek neutrality, and are opposed to socialism, we must begin an official relationship."
 KCS_Completely_Disreagarding_TA:0 "Completely Disregard the Toronto Accords"
 KCS_Completely_Disreagarding_TA_desc:0 "The Toronto Accords are of no concern nor importance to our motherland's national interests. Their attempt to establish a Russian "state" of their own was shot down by our hands, and they have since expressed little to no interest in reasserting control over lands which are rightfully ours. So, we shall pay them no mind."

 KCS_A_Most_Unwanted_Obligation_desc:0 "While we normally would seek to not get involved with them altogether, it is necessary for us to support the furthering of relations between our motherland and the Toronto Accords. We shall make amends, and reach out, so that we may have close relations. On the other hand, however, we must ensure that these relations do not draw us much closer to America."
 KCS_The_Issue_Of_Kurill:0 "The Issue of the Kurils"
 KCS_The_Issue_Of_Kurill_desc:0 "The Kuril islands, located just off the Kamchatka peninsula, are a land which was partitioned between the Russian Empire and Japan in the mid-1800s. However, following the destruction of both the USSR and Empire of Japan, the lands fell from our administration - a grave issue, as they are rightfully our lands. Let us seek to reclaim these lands, through diplomatic channels."

 KCS_Completely_Disregarding_Western_Europe_desc:0 "Western Europe is not something we need to be particularly concerned with at this moment. The French, British, Iberians, and Italians - they all play little to no significant role in Russia's interests. We need not get ourselves involved in their petty squabbles; let them bicker amongst themselves."

 KCS_An_Embassy_In_Ireland_desc:0 "Ireland and Russia have a strange and storied history - something one wouldn't expect from two countries on opposite sides of the continent. However, since the establishment of the Soviet Union, Ireland has failed to recognise us as a nation. That must change; we will seek recognition from Ireland, as well as the other neutral nations of the world."

 KCS_The_Issue_Of_Karelia_desc:0 "The lands of Karelia and the Kola peninsula were illegally seized from us by Finland during the fascist invasion, and have remained in their hands ever since. Home to several Slavs in addition to the native Karelians and the Finns, we are presented with the opportunity to reclaim these lands from the perfidious Finns, or to leave them in Finnish hands. Should we take this chance?"
 KCS_The_Global_Netrality_Movement:0 "Onto the World Stage"
 KCS_The_Global_Netrality_Movement_desc:0 "Few in this world can deny that Russia has returned to the front and centre stage as a global power. We have risen from the laughing stock of the world to an up-and-coming superpower, and the whole world is courting us, trying to get us to go this way and that. But as members of the international community, we must act like it - by joining the United Nations."

 KCS_Continuing_The_Capitalist_Tradition_desc:0 "Now that we are an organisation representing the whole of Russia, we must make it apparent to the rest of the world that this is our intention.

 KCS_Adapting_The_Republican_Base:0 "Apolitical Initiative"
 KCS_Adapting_The_Republican_Base_desc:0 "It seems today that all you see is politics. In the movies, on the radio, in the news, politics has become an inescapable thing. Let us crack down on this over-politicisation of society by supporting a society in which the Russian people are free of politics. No more shall there be politics in the news, or hot-button issues in entertainment. The Russian people can live without such meaningless things as "ideology", "women's rights", and "antisemitism"."
 KCS_Rebuilding_The_Union_Bases:0 "The "Iceberg" and "Taiga" Wings"
 KCS_Rebuilding_The_Union_Bases_desc:0 "Recently, we have begun to see two prominent wings emerge within our party; informally called the "Iceberg" and "Taiga" wings, they have come to dominate the government and decision-making process. This is simply a fact of life, but we must ensure that neither gets too powerful and removes the other from government."

 KCS_Completely_Repairing_The_Trans_Siberian_Raliway_desc:0 "For all the faults of the Soviet Union, one thing that was certainly a success was their industrial efforts. Massive expansion of industry and total reconstruction of the economy from a feudal, agrarian state into a modern industrial model were just some of their achievements on the economic front, despite the failures of the socialist system. Let us bring back the industry of the Soviet Union, for a modern Russia."

 KCS_Incorporating_Both_States_Bureaucracies_desc:0 "It is necessary for us to get a good handle on the whole of the country, and bureaucrats from the old white and red regimes span the majority of the country. Our bureaucrats, on the other hand, come primarily from Central Siberia, and, more specifically, the city of Krasnoyarsk. Though the bureaucrats of the old regimes may remain with some level of resentment towards us; we are all Russians at the end of the day."

 KCS_Barring_All_Old_Regime_Bureaucrats_desc:0 "The bureaucrats of the red and white regimes will not forget their previous political leanings, even if we are to employ them, and they will no doubt make matters worse for us. To let them in would be giving any subversives carte blanche to damage our administrative structures. We will not let them in."
 KCS_Incorporating_Former_Nazi_Industry:0 "Schedule Intra-Party Election"
 KCS_Incorporating_Former_Nazi_Industry_desc:0 "The time has come for us to move towards a party election. Bringing in new blood to replace the old, we shall be truly representative of each and every person within our wide motherland. It will bring in a new bureaucracy, which will not be centred in any one area. It will also show that we are a true force of good, and not some regionalist association."
 KCS_Raze_It_All_To_The_Ground:0 "Russia Needs Strong Leadership!"
 KCS_Raze_It_All_To_The_Ground_desc:0 "The fact of the matter is that Russia is a nation which is simply unprepared for the chaos of democracy.

 KCS_Partisan_Service_Based_Land_Grants_desc:0 "Though we have sought to make life more apolitical, we have not succeeded to the extent that we have so desired. So, it is necessary for us to begin another push for depoliticisation of society, even more fervent than the last. Unlike before, however, we shall seek a continuously-running campaign to remove all politics from daily life."

 KCS_Re-Industrialization_Of_Western_Russia_desc:0 "While we support the investment of foreign private industry into our nations, we must take care that they do not come to dominate our nation. To that end, we shall establish "Special Economic Okrugs" where private companies are afforded more leniency than in the rest of the country. With this method, some areas shall be a sort of experimental testing ground for further liberalisation."

 twrKCS.1.t:0 "LZK One-Party State"
 twrKCS.1.d:0 "The people need to be protected from many things; communism, fascism, liberalism, and perhaps even politics as a whole. They are threatened on all sides, and yet, they cannot be trusted to make their own choices, especially not in this pivotal period. The fractious nature of parties is to be dealt with best - there shall be one party, and it shall be the LZK!"
 twrKCS.1.a:0 "The spine of proper governance!"

 twrKCS.2.t:0 "Siberian Reconstruction Project"
 twrKCS.2.d:0 "The years of chaos, war, and bitter division of the Russian motherland has left little room for economic development. However, now that such problems have been dealt with, we are prepared to bring Siberia into the modern age. We will promote the construction of factories, infrastructure, railways, and so on to bring this wasteland up to speed with the rest of the world."
 twrKCS.2.a:0 "Let's get to work."

 twrKCS.3.t:0 "Trade Delegates from Russia"
 twrKCS.3.d:0 "We have received some interesting visitors as of late; traders from the Russian wastes, representative of the government of Vladimir Dolgikh. It seems Dolgikh is hard at work seeking foreign aid in order to help accelerate the growth of Russia's economy, as well as fostering ties with foreign powers."
 twrKCS.3.a:0 "Interesting."

 twrKCS.4.t:0 "Standardised Office Exams"
 twrKCS.4.d:0 "In order to prevent a repeat of the Soviet Union - a bureaucracy run by uneducated fools - we must see to it that only the most intelligent people are running the nation. For that reason, we will create exams for public officials, not dissimilar from Imperial China, so that we can properly filter the weak from the strong within our civil service."
 twrKCS.4.a:0 "Meritocracy at its finest."

 twrKCS.5.t:0 "Controlled Factionalism"
 twrKCS.5.d:0 "Within any singular organisation, there will be differences, and our party is no different. We have seen the birth of some limited-scale factionalism, but there is no need to fear, for this is all exactly according to plan - we support the beginnings of a democratic system without the nonsense of political parties and formal barriers and divisions."
 twrKCS.5.a:0 "Diversity in unity."

 twrKCS.6.t:0 "Russian Unification"
 twrKCS.6.d:0 "Our former opponents lie at our feet, reduced merely to rubble. Our banners flutter throughout the Russian skies, and dear Vladimir Ivanovich is now the undisputed leader of the nation. We are kings, at last - but only the wastes are our kingdom. There is much work to be done, and we must see to it that Russia is rebuilt and prepared to march onwards, as a modern nation."
 twrKCS.6.a:0 "We shall rise, like a phoenix from the ashes."

 twrKCS.7.t:0 "Vodka Doctrine"
 twrKCS.7.d:0 "It is in our best interests to advance our status globally, and for that reason, we have sought to promote our interests in every significant nation of the world, without care for the ongoing Cold War. Our detractors and some foreign observers have given our doctrine the mocking name of the "Vodka Doctrine", comparing Russia, China, and the United States to a dysfunctional party of drinkers."
 twrKCS.7.a:0 "I'll drink to that."

 twrKCS.8.t:0 "Russia Forms Neutral Movement"
 twrKCS.8.d:0 "It seems that, with the Cold War ongoing between the Republic of China and the Toronto Accord, Russia has chosen not to take sides, instead forming its own self-proclaimed "Neutral Movement", which seeks to promote peaceful cooperation and neutrality between nations. Neither the American nor Chinese diplomatic officials responded for comment, but many have publicly wondered if such an attempt at defusing tensions has any room for success."
 twrKCS.8.a:0 "Neutrality for all!"
 twrKCS.8.b:0 "Interesting."

 twrKCS.9.t:0 "Invitation to the Neutral Movement"
 twrKCS.9.d:0 "Russia has formally invited us to join their self-proclaimed "Neutral Movement", picking neither side in the ongoing Cold War between the United States and the Republic of China. How should we respond to this request?"

 twrKCS.11.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Refuses to Join Neutral Movement"
 twrKCS.11.d:0 "Unfortunately, it seems that [FROM.GetNameDEF] is not willing to support peaceful co-existence; they have refused to join our Neutral Movement."
 twrKCS.11.a:0 "Oh well."

 twrKCS.12.t:0 "Russian Envoys"
 twrKCS.12.d:0 "We have recently received envoys from [KCS.GetNameDef], hoping to further establish and cement diplomatic ties between our two nations.

 twrKCS.12.a:0 "Enjoy your stay!"

 twrKCS.13.t:0 "Russia Demands the Kurils"
 twrKCS.13.d:0 "We have recently received news that [KCS.GetNameDef] has issued a formal notice to our government demanding that we hand over the Kuril Islands to them immediately, claiming that our rule there is a foreign occupation of rightfully-Russian lands. How should we respond to this claim of sovereignty?"
 twrKCS.13.a:0 "They can have it - it's just a bunch of islands."
 twrKCS.13.b:0 "No."

 twrKCS.14.t:0 "Iceberg and Taiga"
 twrKCS.14.d:0 "Recently, we have noticed a disturbing trend of factionalism within our government, as it seems two major "wings" have formed; the Iceberg and the Taiga. While both could present a potential threat to our rule, we will see to it that they do not grow prominent enough to damage our goal of liberating Russia from politics."
 twrKCS.14.a:0 "We are still united!"

 twrKCS.15.t:0 "Intraparty Elections"
 twrKCS.15.d:0 "Today, in the name of democracy within an apolitical system, the first intraparty elections were held. Many different candidates competed, and there was quite some competition between the candidates, reportedly. As the results come in, it appears that neither faction of the party is leading, but as night falls, it becomes clear that..."

 twrKCS.16.t:0 "Apoliticism Prevails"
 twrKCS.16.d:0 "Fortunately for the good of the motherland, the political leeches have not been able to divide us and break us apart. The apolitical faction of the government has prevailed, and we can once more chart a course of unity for the Russian people."
 twrKCS.16.a:0 "Slava!"

 twrKCS.17.t:0 "Federal Russian Unification"
 twrKCS.17.d:0 "News out of the Russian wastes is often scarce and conflicting, but it seems that the last holdouts of governments opposed to [KCS.GetNameDef] of Vladimir Ivanovich Dolgikh have fallen, bringing an end to a long period of warlordism and de facto civil war. Emerging from the collapse of the communist statelet of Krasnoyarsk, Dolgikh has proven to be a moderate man who has sought to remove politics from the lives of the Russian people."
 twrKCS.17.a:0 "A new era!"
 twrKCS.17.b:0 "A united Russia."

 twrKCS.18.t:0 "Russia - Special Economic Okrugs"
 twrKCS.18.d:0 "Following a total victory in the wars to unify Russia, the Russian government has sought to revive the economy and quickly rebuild it. In order to fulfil this goal, Russian leader [KCS.GetLeader] announced today that [KCS.GetNameDef] would establish "Special Economic Okrugs" around places thought to be particularly valuable or ripe for foreign investment. In these areas, there is more economic freedom for domestic and foreign businesses.\n\nForeign companies are already reported to be jumping at the opportunity to advance in Russia extensively. One businessman expressed optimism at the possibility of a future Russian market, saying "It's effectively free real estate ... the Russian market will be enormous in the future.""
