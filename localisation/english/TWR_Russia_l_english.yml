 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 ###########################
 POLITICS_ROGOZHIN_DESC:0 "Possibly one of the most controversial men in modern Russian history, Anatoly Rogozhin was born in 1893 to a cossack upbringing. A veteran of the Great War, he made a name for himself during the tumultuous Russian Civil War, eventually fleeing to Yugoslavia when the White armies collapsed. Serving the interests of White emigres in Yugoslavia until the state's dismemberment by the Third Reich, he joined the newly-founded Russian Republic in the far east. Having been one of the few remaining high ranking officers in the Republic, he was appointed as Chief of Staff by Alexander Kerensky in 1948. After Kerensky's unexpected assassination in 1951, Rogozhin assumed emergency powers to the dismay of the citizens who quickly found themselves under the boot of his armed forces. A deeply unpopular figure amongst pro-democracy supporters and extremist fascists alike, Rogozhin's grip on power remains tenuous at best as the calls for his dictatorial rule to end grow louder by the day."
 POLITICS_IVAN_MIKHAILOV_DESC:0 "Ivan Mikhailov is a figure few in Russia knew before his taking power, within the Russian government however he is notorious for his secretive deals with corporate leaders and his reactionary political views. Born in 1891 to a family of dissidents, he stood out as an extremely gifted student in economics. As various sociopolitical movements gripped the Russian Empire in Ivan's youth, he followed in his father's footsteps joining dissident groups that put him under the scrutiny of the Okhrana.\n\nJoining the Provisional Government in the February Revolution of 1917, Mikhailov quickly climbed the political ladder in the department of agriculture and economics. Fleeing Petrograd following the Bolshevik revolution, he worked under the wing of Supreme Leader of the White Movement Alexandr Kolchak. Earning his reputation as an extremely hard-working and shadow-like figure behind the Kolchak government, he became known in the Russian government as the "Grey Eminence." As Kolchak's far-east government collapsed, he fled to Harbin, organizing an economic bureau for the Chinese Eastern Railway. Collaborating with the Japanese government when they occupied Manchuria, his personal wealth and power skyrocketed.\n\nDisgusted with his former acquaintances in the Russian Fascist Party, he quickly joined Alexander Kerensky's new Russian Republic once Japanese control in Manchuria inevitably collapsed. Proving himself once again a competent minister under Kerensky's tenure, his shock at the president's sudden assassination turned into an opportunity as he allied himself with the widely-unpopular Rogozhin. As anarchy gripped the Republic, Mikhailov primed himself as Rogozhin's successor. As his political gambles have finally paid off, his ideas of a Russian rebirth through mass public works and militarism now find themselves increasingly popular among the Republic's weary populace."
 POLITICS_PITIRIM_SOROKIN_DESC:0 "The life of Pitrim Sorokin is one of great tragedy. Born in 1889 to a family of traveling salesmen in a small Russian village, his childhood was wrought with trouble regarding his alcoholic father. Fleeing his abusive household alongside his brother at the age of eleven, the two moved to Saint Petersberg and gradually made a name for themselves as artisans. Sorokin would go on to study criminology at Saint Petersberg University, working as a professor. Joining the Socialist-Revolutionary Party when the Tsar abdicated, Sorokin became a close confidant of Alexander Kerensky and the Provisional Government. Moving to the United States after the Russian Civil War, he continued work as a professor until the re-establishment of the Russian Republic. Joining the restored SRs alongside his old colleagues, the thought of leading the Republic's strongest party following the unexpected deaths of Alexander Kerensky and Viktor Chernov had caught him off-guard. While it is a heavy mantle to carry, the leadership of the beloved "Kerenskyites" is one that Sorokin now flaunts with the grace and cunning of a modern statesman."
 POLITICS_VLADIMIR_NABOKOV_DESC:0 "Vladimir Nabokov was born in 1899 to a wealthy family of Russian nobles. A predominantly liberal household, his father had been a powerful leader of the Russian Empire's Kadet party. Nabokov's childhood had been an extremely pampered one, spending much of his youth in the family estate. Forced to flee Russia when the Bolsheviks seized power in 1917, Nabokov and his family took their wealth and fled to Berlin. Traumatized by his father's murder at the hands of Russian monarchists in 1922, the young Nabokov took to writing, becoming a renowned poet and author within the Russian emigre community. Having married a young Russian-Jewish woman, they fled to the United States in 1936 as Nazi Germany's antisemitic rhetoric became increasingly violent. Settling in the United States, Nabokov was delighted to hear the news of America's Siberian intervention and was one of the first prominent emigres to return to Russia. Following in his father's footsteps, Nabokov helped re-establish the old Constitutional Democratic Party with Vasily Maklakov. Leading the party in the wake of Maklakov's retirement, the hearts of the Russian people now rest beneath the stroke of the president's pen."
 POLITICS_RANDOLPH_PATE_DESC:0 "Randolph McCall Pate had zero desire for the job thrust upon him: Head of the Toronto Accord Transitional Government of the Russian Republic. Commandant of the United States Marine Corps, Randolph was born on the 11th of February 1898 in South Carolina, joining the Army in 1918. Serving with distinction during the Pacific campaign against the Japanese, Pate rose through the ranks to become a general within the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Assigned to oversee the transitional government for Russia, there's only one thing that remains on General Pate's mind. What vengeful God forced him to such a miserable post and when could he finally come home?"
 POLITICS_ALEKSANDR_SOLZHENITSYN_DESC:0 "Alexandr Solzhenitsyn is somewhat of a dark horse in the scene of Russian politics. He was born in 1918 to a family of wealthy landowners and when his Tsarist officer father was killed in a hunting accident, the young Solzhenitsyn was raised by his widowed mother to be a devout Orthodox Christian. An aspiring novelist at the height of Stalin's great purges, his doubts about the moral fabric of the Soviet system began implanting themselves in him as the Soviet government seemed more focused on maintaining "ideological purity" than fighting the Germans. Deserting his unit in 1944, the battle-hardened Solzhenistyn fled East from the Wehrmacht and took refuge in the small city of Blagoveshchensk. Embracing staunch Russian nationalism as American troops intervened in the far-east, he quickly rose through the ranks of the Russian community's centre-right political circles as a young firebrand that could rally many to his calls for a return to the days of Russian prestige. Taking control of the Octobrist Party shortly after Rogozhin's resignation, Solzhenistyn has campaigned tirelessly to fulfill his dreams of a Russia made great again, despite the years of political instability that rocked the young Republic. While a controversial figure among secularists for his deep religiousness and minority groups due to rumours of his antisemitism, his following of die-hard supporters see President Solzhenitsyn as the first true saviour of Holy Russia since the days of the Tsars.

Stressing rapid-pace development and modernisation, it also notes the importance of keeping the population happy. In order to make Russia into a superpower from an agrarian backwater, the Office of Modernisation and Development has been entrusted with an annual budget of 8 billion rubles in order to effectively manage the programme of development, as well as the ability to raise and lower taxes as they see fit.\n\nThe consciousness of the population is best off low, lest the peasants revolt. The annual spending must be kept within the budget, at risk of punishment from the government, and further development means greater investment and support.\n\nThe consciousness of the population is currently [?RUS_Ivanomika_consciousness|R]\nWe have currently spent [?RUS_Ivanomika_spending|Y]§Y0.00§! rubles out of 8,000,000,000.\nWe are currently a [Root.Ivanomika_Development] ([?RUS_Ivanomika_development|R] development) nation."

 RUS_Intro_Our_Flags_at_Half_Mast:0 "Our Flags at Half-Mast"
 RUS_Intro_Our_Flags_at_Half_Mast_desc:0 "Our nation continues to mourn the death of our late president Alexander Kerensky, and the mourning masses have turned to rage against our government for failing to uphold his ideas. We will have to tread carefully going forward, lest our people's collective rage and grief consumes our nation whole."
 RUS_Intro_Rogozhins_Speech:0 "Rogozhin's Speech"
 RUS_Intro_Rogozhins_Speech_desc:0 "Our nation's state is once again one of chaos. Protesters are attempting to tear apart what we salvaged from the Republic! The junta has agreed that it would be best if Rogozhin publicly spoke out against the injustice of these "protesters". He is going to calm them down, speak to the hearts of those who really love our republic. Our Russia! Those that do will naturally stand down..."
 RUS_Intro_Extending_the_Curfew:0 "Extending the Curfew"
 RUS_Intro_Extending_the_Curfew_desc:0 "No republic can survive the use of violence for political means becoming an acceptable strategy. It was what destroyed the ancient Roman Republic, it transformed Weimar Germany into our worst nightmare, and as battling in the streets continues to plague us, it shall surely spell the end for the Russian Republic as well. Something must be done to save us before it is too late: Though extending the military curfew sounds as though it is restricting freedom, it is, in reality, saving the freedom of our great democracy, allowing it to live another day."
 RUS_Intro_Meeting_the_Provisional_Duma:0 "Meeting the Provisional Duma"
 RUS_Intro_Meeting_the_Provisional_Duma_desc:0 "The disbanded Provisional Duma is going to be summoned for the speech. They will witness Rogozhin doing what he does best. Ensuring stability. We must convince them that he is just and that democracy is coming, however, the people need to be prepared for it. We need to be prepared for it."
 RUS_Intro_Reaffirm_Our_TA_Commitments:0 "Reaffirm Our TA Commitments"
 RUS_Intro_Reaffirm_Our_TA_Commitments_desc:0 "As we need to ensure our stability and continued growth, we need to make sure we continue cooperating with the Toronto Accord. We shall send letters, declarations, requests and most importantly; representatives. We need to improve our relations with their key players. In time, we might liberate all Russians and keep them safe, but even though we try as hard as we possibly can, we cannot do it without powerful backers."
 RUS_Intro_Our_Two_Diseases:0 "Our Two Diseases"
 RUS_Intro_Our_Two_Diseases_desc:0 "We need to start fighting the two diseases that plague our wonderful republic. Fascism and communism, both extreme opposite ends of the political spectrum. It is time that we rid our republic of these tumors. Our people will not be influenced by such terrorist groups! It was them who caused this madness to begin with! Surely!"
 RUS_Intro_The_Disease_of_the_Heart:0 "The Disease of the Heart"
 RUS_Intro_The_Disease_of_the_Heart_desc:0 "Communism; the disease of the heart! It plagues the human heart and, by extension, the soul. It distorts the desires of the people, misguiding them into ignorant liberty that restrains them more than the Tsars have ever tried to restrict them. We need to cut it out, carefully, from the heart. It is a tumour. after all: Not always incurable, but it needs to be removed on time."
 RUS_Intro_Demonise_the_Leninists:0 "Demonise the Leninists"
 RUS_Intro_Demonise_the_Leninists_desc:0 "Vladimir Ilyich Lenin - a joke! An opportunist, manipulating people into following him, preaching false liberty. Nothing is really free about the state he created. It has nothing to do with a true republic, let alone our republic! We shall preach the truth to the population! Demonise them! Force the people to picture them for the demons they are! It is all, of course, a slight exaggeration - though such things have never hurt anyone."
 RUS_Intro_Shut_Down_Bolshevik_Publications:0 "Shut Down Bolshevik Publications"
 RUS_Intro_Shut_Down_Bolshevik_Publications_desc:0 "Everyone in this state is free. Everyone is free to say what they want to say - as long as it does not hurt their neighbors. And this - this is why we have to shut down the Bolshevik publications. Not only are they disgusting, but also endanger other citizens. They are free to preach for now, but they will not reach more people with their stupidity, terrorism, hatred and manipulation."
 RUS_Intro_Meet_With_the_Protesters:0 "Meet With the Protesters"
 RUS_Intro_Meet_With_the_Protesters_desc:0 "In order to prove we are allies of the poor, we need to meet with the moderates and other protesters. It is slightly risky and certainly nothing we are comfortable with, but we are dedicated to saving this republic. In memory of all we stood and stand for, we shall meet with them, and perhaps do some negotiating..."
 RUS_Intro_Promising_a_Return_to_Normalcy:0 "Promising a Return to Normalcy"
 RUS_Intro_Promising_a_Return_to_Normalcy_desc:0 "As we intend to balance out our ideals, we must promise a return to normalcy to the people and to the politicians. We promise an end to insecurity of the state, of the people, of liberty, of the republic and of our system. We promise an end to the political brutality, however one perceives it, an end to system abnormality, and resolutions to all other issues that make our small society "abnormal"."
 RUS_Intro_Preparing_to_Face_the_Warlords:0 "Preparing to Face the Warlords"
 RUS_Intro_Preparing_to_Face_the_Warlords_desc:0 "We must prepare to get rid of those illegitimate governments to the West. Those warlords. Nothing good ever comes from their actions. They are chaotic and spread war. We must rid of the world of such "governments". However, even though they are not our smartest foes, we are not equipped to deal with these "leaders". Therefore, we start our preparation in the name of order and liberty in our region. Therefore, we shall build forts as our forces gather strength, preparing for our inevitable take-over of their unrecognized false countries."
 RUS_Intro_The_Disease_of_the_Skin:0 "The Disease of the Skin"
 RUS_Intro_The_Disease_of_the_Skin_desc:0 "Fascism...national socialism! They are the same thing, a disease of skin! Dangerous, yet unforeseen. This disease requires further investigation and careful inspection before we are able to get rid of it. Cut out this tumor causing the skin cancer plaguing our society. Extremists are terrorists. That is how we shall treat them."
 RUS_Intro_Ban_Vonsiatsky:0 "Ban Vonsiatsky"
 RUS_Intro_Ban_Vonsiatsky_desc:0 "Though the RFP makes up the primary threat to democracy on the right, we must also take into consideration other émigrés from around the world. Though those in France and former Yugoslavia hold no sway over us, we must keep in mind those in Britain, America, and Canada. People such as Anastasy Vonsiatsky could potentially be a large threat to our republic and our democracy. For that reason, we shall declare Vonsiatsky and his compatriots to be personas non grata within our country."
 RUS_Intro_Shut_Down_Fascist_Publications:0 "Shut Down Fascist Publications"
 RUS_Intro_Shut_Down_Fascist_Publications_desc:0 "As they have lost the battle with the sword, the RFP has shifted their strategy to battling with the pen instead. Even now, pro-fascist and anti-republic propaganda is circulating around true Russia: Posters appear on every street corner, pamphlets and leaflets line the streets, and underground papers have even begun appearing in public. This cannot be allowed to continue. Their publications will burn, and as we destroy it all, their ideology will die. We will not allow their malice to infect our people."
 RUS_Intro_Stoke_the_Flames_of_Anti_Germanism:0 "Stoke the Flames of Anti-Germanism"
 RUS_Intro_Stoke_the_Flames_of_Anti_Germanism_desc:0 "Every Russian knows, in their heart of hearts, that not every German is a Nazi. However, every Nazi has become a German. They have sold out their nation, their people, their religion, even their own family, in service to the great beast of National Socialism. That, we can use. We must begin to properly educate our people: The communists, however bitter of enemies we may be, are ultimately Russians just as the rest of us, and are only doing what they perceive to be best for the nation, however misguided they may be. The Germans, on the other hand, are the true enemy. They wish nothing but destruction on us, and so, we must wish nothing but the same upon them. The Huns, the Teutons, the demons...They must die. For Russia."
 RUS_Intro_Vladivostoks_Fascist_Underbelly:0 "Vladivostok's Fascist Underbelly"
 RUS_Intro_Vladivostoks_Fascist_Underbelly_desc:0 "As we finally conclude our investigation into the fascist disease, we have reached a point of actual harm of not only our political system, but our society as a whole. Those bastards praising Dolfy and Benito all the time are more chaotic than what they claim to be fighting for. In our beautiful city of Vladivostok, these rats are operating shady organizations that commit numerous crimes, such as racketeering, extortion, illegal gambling, the whole ordeal. Our next move is a police crackdown on all of these activities and arrests of their leaders. Our police force shall march victoriously, as previously marched the Tsarist army, the Czechoslovak Legion and even our own army. They shall deliver justice and rid our mighty republic of this fascist plague."
 RUS_Intro_Reinforce_the_Borderlands:0 "Reinforce the Borderlands"
 RUS_Intro_Reinforce_the_Borderlands_desc:0 "Now that we have rooted out the disease of the skin, it is time to move onto other important matters. One of these is of course securing the outskirts of our Republic. There was always chaos there, but we are prepared to end it. No other government ever was or ever will be as successful at rooting out the chaotic element of itself as we are."
 RUS_Intro_The_Dumas_Grand_Reopening:0 "The Duma's Grand Reopening"
 RUS_Intro_The_Dumas_Grand_Reopening_desc:0 "It is time. After so much time spent preparing and repairing... we are finally able to reopen The Duma. The most sacred political building in our Republic. It is what we and our public worship as the heart and soul of our democratic ideals. Our ideals of law, order and liberty! No blissful ignorance under fascist or communist regimes formed by bastards, opportunists, criminals or simply greedy politicians! We live in liberty. We abide the law and we keep peace and order in our streets!"

 RUS_intro1_tree:0 "Introductory Tree, Part 2"
 RUS_Intro1_The_Dumas_Grand_Reopening:0 "The Duma's Grand Reopening"
 RUS_Intro1_The_Dumas_Grand_Reopening_desc:0 "It is time. After so much time spent preparing and repairing... we are finally able to reopen The Duma. The most sacred political building in our Republic. It is what we and our public worship as the heart and soul of our democratic ideals. Our ideals of law, order and liberty! No blissful ignorance under fascist or communist regimes formed by bastards, opportunists, criminals or simply greedy politicians! We live in liberty. We abide the law and we keep peace and order in our streets!"
 RUS_Intro1_More_Fuel_on_the_Fire:0 "More Fuel on the Fire"
 RUS_Intro1_More_Fuel_on_the_Fire_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, the Russian Republic is in absolute chaos. The people are practically rioting in the streets, no longer able to tolerate the Caesarian cognitive dissonance between serving a supposed democracy headed by little more than a dictator. We have several choices on how to proceed, but all of them sacrifice something; all contribute to the inferno. So then, do we add more fuel to the fire of instability, or insurrection?"
 RUS_Intro1_Trust_in_Rogozhin:0 "Trust in Rogozhin"
 RUS_Intro1_Trust_in_Rogozhin_desc:0 "Even though our current leader had ended our wonderful democracy, he did it in defence of the Republic. Therefore, we trust in him to return to democracy. One man, who offered his soul in defence of liberty cannot be the murderer of sad liberty...can he?"
 RUS_Intro1_Mikhailov_Leads_the_Way:0 "Mikhailov Leads the Way"
 RUS_Intro1_Mikhailov_Leads_the_Way_desc:0 "Rogozhin's economic minister, Ivan Mikhailov, has for ages held significant influence within the military government. Influential among big business interests and some right-wing politicians, Mikhailov has given President Rogozhin an easy way out of the current political crisis: Resign and appoint him as successor. The move may not be welcomed by the more liberal-leaning politicians, perhaps organizing an "election" might placate them and end the ongoing crisis."
 RUS_Intro1_Jingoist_Propaganda:0 "Jingoist Propaganda"
 RUS_Intro1_Jingoist_Propaganda_desc:0 "Russia has been butchered by the Nazis and the power-hungry Bolsheviks. All of Russia remains a divided mess with only us in the far-east standing as a beacon of liberty for all. It is up to us and us alone to bring all of Russia's splinters back into one, a nation that will stand up against Hitler and bring Russia back onto the world stage."
 RUS_Intro1_Limiting_the_Press:0 "Limiting the Press"
 RUS_Intro1_Limiting_the_Press_desc:0 "Throughout the post-Kerensky political crisis, newspapers from across the political spectrum have regularly churned out inflammatory pieces criticizing the govenrment of being dictatorial and undermining our efforts to reunite the nation. These sorts of trouble-making writers are dangerous for the government and only set us back, and they MUST be silenced so the public can unite under one goal: reunification."
 RUS_Intro1_Allying_the_Industrialists:0 "Allying the Industrialists"
 RUS_Intro1_Allying_the_Industrialists_desc:0 "They say that war is good for business, and in our fledgling Republic this is certainly the case. Industrial interests have taken a very keen interest in expanding operations of arms factories. This will undoubtedly be a boon for our armed forces and give Russians much-needed jobs, and will bring the rich on board with our government. What is there to lose?"
 RUS_Intro1_Marginalise_the_Kerenskyites:0 "Marginalise the Kerenskyites"
 RUS_Intro1_Marginalise_the_Kerenskyites_desc:0 "Kerensky is beloved by many, however the way they express this "love" isn't exactly helpful. As much as it is important to see the new government as a continuation of the ideals of the original Russian Republic, we will also have to sweep away the more....problematic "Kerenskyites" to create a new and better nation."
 RUS_Intro1_Rogozhin_Stays:0 "Rogozhin Stays"
 RUS_Intro1_Rogozhin_Stays_desc:0 "The Russian nation is too dangerous and unstable to simply hand over to a civilian government. While the people insist on this, this is for the better. If the republic is to survive, it will need an army strongman like Rogozhin to bring it all together until the Russian nation is finally ready for a democratic government."
 RUS_Intro1_Integrating_the_Octobrists:0 "Integrating the Octobrists"
 RUS_Intro1_Integrating_the_Octobrists_desc:0 "The Octobrist Party has many who wouldn't mind a stronger military government, and their support would be much appreciated going forward. We should invite a select few of Octobrist members into our military government as a gesture to the protestors that we are on their side."
 RUS_Intro1_Gaining_NTS_Funding:0 "Gaining NTS Funding"
 RUS_Intro1_Gaining_NTS_Funding_desc:0 "The National Alliance of Russian Solidarists is an extremely minor party in the Russian Republic, however, they are quite wealthy. Promoting Russian nationalist principles and reactionary politics, they are natural allies of the army government. Perhaps it is time we bring them on board?"
 RUS_Intro1_Mikhailovs_Government:0 "Mikhailov's Government"
 RUS_Intro1_Mikhailovs_Government_desc:0 "As we reinforce our government with actual administrators, we must naturally pick an administrator to lead us, although he seems to be loyal to our ideals and the militarist nature of our government, he also served as the first Minister of Economy of the FREE Russia!"
 RUS_Intro1_Cement_Army_Rule:0 "Cement Army Rule"
 RUS_Intro1_Cement_Army_Rule_desc:0 "Now that we established everything needed for a military government, we shall cement the rule of the army. Lead us to more victories, sir Rogozhin!"
 RUS_Intro1_Immortalise_the_Father_and_Son_of_Free_Russia:0 "Immortalise the Father and Son of Free Russia"
 RUS_Intro1_Immortalise_the_Father_and_Son_of_Free_Russia_desc:0 "With our government finally in proper place, we must immortalize the images of our greatest leaders into history! They were the ones who took what was left of freedom and liberty in Russia and let in thrive! We owe our lives to Kerensky and Rogozhin!"
 RUS_Intro1_A_Russian_Cincinnatus:0 "A Russian Cincinnatus"
 RUS_Intro1_A_Russian_Cincinnatus_desc:0 "Our current leader, Rogozhin, has finally decided that an eventual return to democracy, be it a slower one or a quicker one, is the only way to save our liberty we treasure so dearly. It is the only way to save the Republic. He became dictator in defence of the Republic and now he ends his rule in defence of liberty and the Republic. In this sense, can can be compared to Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus back in ancient times. Rogozhin is OUR Cincinnatus."
 RUS_Intro1_Reignite_the_Torch_of_Liberty:0 "Reignite the Torch of Liberty"
 RUS_Intro1_Reignite_the_Torch_of_Liberty_desc:0 "Liberty is what our every citizen is willing to die for! Liberty is a torch of hope! Liberty is what defines human nature, it is what we naturally strive for! It is time we reignite that torch that was put out by a strong wind that took the poor Kerensky away! We are lighting this torch in his memory for liberty!"
 RUS_Intro1_Relax_Some_Restrictions:0 "Relax Press Restrictions"
 RUS_Intro1_Relax_Some_Restrictions_desc:0 "As a result of the wind that put out the torch of liberty and the life of Kerensky, the press was restricted in the name of said liberty in hopes no such event would ever happen again. Now we realize our mistake. Not only is this one of the most important steps to a true Republic, but also an enabling act. An enabling act for the watchdog of democracy, the press, to defend the citizens again injustice!"
 RUS_Intro1_Enforce_Apoliticism_in_the_Army:0 "Enforce Apoliticism in the Army"
 RUS_Intro1_Enforce_Apoliticism_in_the_Army_desc:0 "To make sure no event such as our previous Civil War ever happens again, we must enforce our policy of an apolitical army ! As we see it, Army is to protect the state...not define it any longer."
 RUS_Intro1_Dismissing_the_NTS:0 "Dismissing the NTS"
 RUS_Intro1_Dismissing_the_NTS_desc:0 "Even though the NTS are still a somewhat sympathetic band, we must dismiss them in order for true liberty to bless our Republic. It will take our connections as well as decisive action in order for us to finally dismiss them, but it will be worth it ! They will become irrelevant and our citizens will be free of their influence."
 RUS_Intro1_Guarantees_for_Democratisation:0 "Guarantees for Democratisation"
 RUS_Intro1_Guarantees_for_Democratisation_desc:0 "Today, our administration gives guarantees to the people and the politicians, including the former Provisional Duma, that we shall restore democracy. The real face of liberty in our Republic ! We shall do so with respect and honor for not only the citizens, but tha late Kerensky as well. After all a republic is a public matter..."
 RUS_Intro1_Talk_With_the_Democrats:0 "Talk With the Democrats"
 RUS_Intro1_Talk_With_the_Democrats_desc:0 "We are nearing the final push towards democracy and one of the last steps are negotiations with the democrats. With people, who are going to remain faces of this country with blessings of the people and with the will of the people. We must include their side of the story and their ideas in our sessions."
 RUS_Intro1_Ending_Martial_Law:0 "Ending Martial Law"
 RUS_Intro1_Ending_Martial_Law_desc:0 "Since the horrific murder of Kerensky we have ruled with marshal law. While an understanding move for a limited period of time, this marshal law has been extended for too long. It is time we end it and allow for our courts to get back to work again. Just law will be back in Russia by the end of today!"
 RUS_Intro1_Prepare_for_the_Elections:0 "Prepare for the Elections"
 RUS_Intro1_Prepare_for_the_Elections_desc:0 "The time has come. We have finally decided to prepare for elections. Liberty and the voice of citizens yelling that they are once again part of the state can be heard across our Republic as the people rejoice."
 RUS_Intro1_Bidding_Farewell_to_Politics:0 "Bidding Farewell to Politics"
 RUS_Intro1_Bidding_Farewell_to_Politics_desc:0 "Rogozhin announced that his time has come. It is now that he decided to leave office and bid farewell to petty politics that he got himself involved with. Some rejoice, others respect the decision with some regret. Most can agree, however, that this will bring us bright future for the people and the Republic!"

The best way to do this is to meet with them."

 RUS_Esery_The_Farm_Forclosure_Act_desc:0 "Many farmers have not been able to keep paying for their farms. However, for many people, they have no responsibility for this, and it is entirely out of their control. We must try to remedy this, and make it easier for farmers to pay. To this end, we must seek to make foreclosure rarer. After all, these people are the ones feeding the nation, and deserve our utmost support."
 RUS_Esery_Meet_With_Unions:0 "Meet With Unions"
 RUS_Esery_Meet_With_Unions_desc:0 "Labour unions are critical. The right to strike is, for the most part, inalienable, and we respect that.

We shall look to his example, implementing much of what he proposed as President, and put it into practise as we recover from the chaos of the Rogozhin regime.

In short: the taxes are too damn high for many of Russia's poor. And for the peasantry, this issue is multiplied in magnitude.

Yet, for various reasons, primarily the do-nothing attitude of the Rogozhin junta, we have not yet begun to tap these resources to any serious potential - a nigh-criminal act, with all the wealth we could have if prospected. We must get to work, immediately, on exploiting the land."

However, since the slaying of Kerensky, it seems as if many men in the Republic have forgotten such things, chasing profits for their pockets instead of positives for the people.

We must put this all behind us, however, and bring about a new era of patriotism. No resident of Russia will feel like a foreigner in the country, and no Russian will be just a number on bureaucratic papers. They are the people of Russia, and will be recognized as such.

We all know very well that such hate speech is extremely dangerous and we must put it under control - but how? Many support hate speech laws, but we can see that banning it will only bring more attention to it, akin to the forbidden fruit of the Old Testament.

 russia.1.d:0 "In the wake of the collapse of Soviet authority, the United States launched an invasion of the Far East, installing a regime under the name of the Russian Democratic Federative Republic. Billing itself as the continuation of the republic in 1917, the Republic called upon all Russians, émigré and mainlander, to Vladivostok in the name of democracy and stability.\n\nChief among these returnees was none other than disgraced former president of Russia Alexander Kerensky, whom the Americans installed as interim president to create the ideal Russia, free and democratic. Over the next few years, Kerensky and the provisional Duma worked day and night to restore freedom and stability to the region, all the while drafting a constitution based on the one they wrote thirty years earlier.\n\nHowever, this progress came crashing down in 1951, when the Russian Fascist Party bombed the Duma, leaving Kerensky and several other, more minor, politicians dead as martyrs. The ensuing turmoil proved to be too much for Prime Minister Chernov to handle, and, days after the attack, the military took control of the government and declared martial law. Russia enters 1952 with an uncertain future ahead, as pressure from within and enemies from without threaten to topple what may be Russia's last chance at democracy..."

 russia.2.t:0 "Rogozhin's Speech"
 russia.2.d:0 "It seemed like it had been forever since Rogozhin introduced martial law across the country, and to say it was unpopular was an understatement. Protests were on the streets on a daily basis, and the Americans seemed discontent. Frustrated, Rogozhin paced around his office; how could he curb the unrest? It was quite minimal in decoration - his desk had only an empty ashtray and a half-empty glass. And then, at once, he thought up what to do.\n\nGetting up from the table where he was sitting pensively, Rogozhin moved to the door. As he opened it, he intercepted an assistant. "Come here," he said blunty. "You're Vasily, right?" The assistant cautiously answered. "Yes, mister President. What is it?" Rogozhin approached him, and whispered, saying, "Listen carefully. The situation on the streets is out of control, and we need to resolve it quickly. You know the military radio? Go to him, tell him I'll be there tomorrow." Vasily nodded quickly. "Yes, mister President," he said, before disappearing in a flash.\n\nThe next day, Rogozhin entered the station. As he moved to the broadcasting room, escorted by an armed detail of soldiers, he thought to himself. He wished to remain in power, but alas, he truly did not have a choice. In all likelihood, the Americans would take action if he remained in power, and if he re-established democracy then he would have no chance of re-election. Perhaps, he thought, he could reach out to a minister, but by the time he had that thought, he had reached the broadcasting room. It was his time.\n\n"Russians," Rogozhin began, "I am addressing you today as your friend. We are in crisis. I assure you that this declaration of martial law was a necessity. Had it not been for this, we would have fallen into civil war once again - just as the fascists want." He wiped his brow and sipped on his water before continuing. "I, too, desire democracy, but it is no secret that we must make a better Russia, first. If you are a true lover of freedom, then you shall heed my words, and end this protesting at once.""

 russia.3.d:0 "Think, think, think. All I need is a convincing poster that would show all the dangers of communism, the artist thought to himself. What was he to do? He had the capital in front of him, piles of the dead engulfed in the flames of communism. The monster was moving towards the lines of soldiers, defending their nation from the impending catastrophe on the pier, bearing the name of communism engraved in their bones. The buildings hid many people and, as the beast rushed in their direction, they prayed that the reds would not take them alive. It seemed ridiculous.\n\nThen the artist came up with the idea of a new monster - a long-condemned man who rose from Hell to swallow the innocent population. There was nothing left of him, only bones that signified his raw materiality, without skin and muscles, only bones as sharp as a cold blade. The people would know that communism was the devil's work. On the other side were the soldiers, supporters of democracy, and between them was a bridge over a river, separating heaven and hell.\n\nAfter all, hell was a place for communists. Life under Lenin and Stalin had been a reign of terror on the common people, and heaven was a democratic relief. If the people did not support democracy, they would be thrust into a hellish reprise of the Stalinist Great Terror - this time, perhaps never to recover."

Even since the 1951 tragedy, followers of the perfidious Russian Fascist Party continue to infiltrate every layer of Russian society. They are everywhere, from businesses to brothels. Such political and social influence cannot be held by any group - and certainly not Germanophile fascists.\n\nYes, we must begin to fight the fascist menace, and we must stamp out the genocidal fascist disease at every opportunity. However, it is not simply the RFP that we must fight, but its sister organisations, as well. Anastasy Vonsiatsky and his lackeys shall no longer be permitted to enter our glorious republic. Their motherland is not ours. We desire democracy, freedom, and equality, while they believe in authoritarianism, oppression, and supremacy of the few."

 russia.5.d:0 "It was a long and expensive process, but the bombed-out Duma building has finally been reopened for delegates and the public alike. As cheering crowds pack Vladivostok's central square to hear Rogozhin's speech, they hoped that it would also be his resignation so that the torch of liberty could burn once again.\n\nThey were mistaken.\n\nCiting the continued banditry and lawlessness in both the Republic's outskirts and Vladivostok itself, Anatoly Rogozhin has announced that the Duma elections will have to be delayed further until "internal matters" have been dealt with. An immediate row of jeers and hissing from the crowd interrupted the remainder of Rogozhin's speech, forcing him to leave the podium with two bodyguards at his side. "
 russia.5.a:0 "It has to be done."

 russia.6.t:0 "Trusting in Rogozhin"
 russia.6.d:0 "Rogozhin is right about one thing; The democratic process will serve only to weaken the Republic further. Looking to maintain military rule one way or the other, there are only two real options on the table: Have the renowned economist and shrewd pragmatist Ivan Mikhailov take the reigns, or the riskier option of maintaining the dictatorship and eliminating all opposition no matter the cost."

 russia.8.d:0 "Our efforts of keeping indefinite military rule have so far only barely succeeded, but there is one last minor issue; The constitution. While it has been only half-written before Rogozhin stepped in, it has nonetheless been the only document preventing him from bringing peace and stability to his new Russia. Talking at great lengths with the Chiefs of Staff, Rogozhin has effectively nullified the constitution in the hopes of finally defeating all of Russia's internal and external threats without the cumbersome hamperings of democracy."

 russia.11.t:0 "An Anticlimatic Departure"
 russia.11.d:0 "The office was empty by now, and now-former president Anatoly Rogozhin left his office. Before turning around and leaving the building, he took one last look at his office. It was never really his, but he had taken it up for the country's sake. In doing so he had become one of the most hated men in Russia outside of Lenin or even Hitler. It was time, he thought to himself, turning the corner and exiting the building where his chauffer was waiting in a car. The marshal's career has finally ended, and he looked forward to a comfortable retirement at his quiet villa."
 russia.11.a:0 "The most controversial men leave quietly."

 russia.12.t:0 "The Universities Run Red"
 russia.12.d:0 "The students were standing firm despite the tanks parked outside the university's gated entrance. They held signs and banners reading "Down with fascism! Down with Ivan Mikhailov!" The students were also shouting increasingly profane words at the troops staring them down. The commander was busy on the radio trying to reach central command, sitting behind a tank and hoping to receive orders on how to proceed. After a long conversation with his superiors, he finally hung up the radio equipment and called on his subordinates in the platoon. His orders were simple and to the point: "Breakthrough the student horde and teach them a lesson they haven't had a chance to learn in their schools." The tank commanders and riot police nodded their heads, it was time to put down the dissenters. Giving one last order on the radio, the tanks began rolling directly towards the gate, much to the surprise of the protesting students. As rubber bullets flew across the campus and police batons struck everyone that seemed to turn out, the commotion gradually died down.\n Ambulances were quick to arrive on scene, and the listed casualties showed only minimal losses: 41 injured, 12 seriously. As the dust settles and the newspapers report the incident to praise the government's response to "Uppity anarchists", some begin to wonder if these crackdowns will become a fact of life under Mikhailov."
 russia.12.a:0 "Perhaps bruises build character."

 russia.13.t:0 "Conclusion Of The [GetYear] "Election""
 russia.13.d:0 "Just as President Mikhailov promised, elections did come. These elections, however, had a tricky catch. Using the full might of local police, polling stations were heavily guarded and voters harassed under the pretence of "preventing fascist sabotage". Trucks carrying uncounted ballots were systemically "searched" for faulty ballots with many simply being torn up and thrown into the wind. As opposition leaders were arrested for speaking out against what they believed to be blatant voter fraud, the "votes" were finally counted the following morning:\n\n\n The results were an overwhelming National Solidarist majority with opposition parties winning barely a handful of seats in total. While scattered groups of protestors took to the streets to decry the election, the majority of citizens just seem thankful that a stable government with a proper mandate is finally in charge again. With full control of the press, security forces, the constitution and now the legitimacy to back it up, the future plans for President-Elect Ivan Mikhailov seem just around the corner now."

 russiacrisis.1.d:0 "Descending from railway stations, highways and entering the streets from various buildings throughout the capital, the people gathered in a massive protest after Rogozhin declared his desire to become dictator for life. Police were put on general alert after an incident erupted in which a police officer was killed by several people from the demonstration, all of whom were then promptly arrested. Now the protests have tripled as even larger groups of people take to the streets. Police officers greeted a general mass of people, unprepared for the number set in front of their defense wing for the battle with police to end after just ten minutes of fighting after police had to withdraw as protesters began pushing them against a wall. This incident appears to only be the starting point of a wave of anarchy comparable only to the pre-Republican anarchy."

 russiacrisis.2.d:0 "Banks within the Republic were full of people frightened by the general instability within the Republic today. People were colliding with each other, carrying suitcases full of their life savings: all in the American Dollar. Opening the door to the exit of the bank, Davidovich looked west, thinking about how he could ever pay for something as basic as food for his family now that the Ruble was all but useless now. He collided with Zagorkin, who was just coming to the bank, and thinking that Davidović had attacked him, Zagorkin hit him hard with his fist, knocking him to the ground and leaving him unconscious. In the hysteria that arose, thinking it was the police, the people fled while Zagorkin took a briefcase from Davidovic containing his life savings, leaving him to the fates. "

 russiacrisis.3.d:0 "Anarchy has become a common term used over the past few weeks, but Rogozhin decided that now was the best time to deal with this whole situation that was spiraling out of control. He climbed on the balcony of the Duma, looking at the enraged protestors below. He had to say something, anything, that would calm down the people. "Dear people..." As his speech continued to ramble on about the need for unity and peace, a student named Konstantin broke into the front rows and, raising his gun, fired three shots. One hit Rogozhin in the stomach, repelling him and staggering him backward. The second shot hit him in the shoulder and threw him to the left, as the third shot hit Rogozhin straight in the spleen. As aides quickly dragged his bleeding body away from the public eye, mass hysteria broke out in the central square as it seemed that not even the central government could save them anymore."

(Full speech on page five)\n\nMany are unsure of this step, some going as far as to call the United States of America imperialists, and this entire ordeal an attack on the sovereignty of our Republic. There are already many rumors going around about this temporary administration being a total coup executed by the Americans. Others accuse our fellow citizens of espionage and other acts of treason! One bit of gossip, however, sticks out amidst all of these, and is the most popular by far: Randolph Pete will not be sticking around for very long.

As the admiral once sat in Omsk and Vladivostok fighting the Bolshevik menace, his spiritual successor Ivan Mikhailov now sits liberating all of Russia from warlords, fascists, and communists. Seeking to formalize our ties to the government of old, the Alexandr Kolchak museum has opened in Vladivostok. The new museum showcases everything from a recreation of his former office to era-specific uniforms of White Army soldiers and of course, Kolchak's uniform itself. An instant hit with the public, the Kolchak museum is only the beginning of free Russia's great transformation into a new age."

The generals, soldiers and other traitors and collaborators with the Red Army are finally to face justice for their crimes - against humanity, against liberty, against the people, and their basic rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nThe evidence is overwhelming, in the mere existence of the NKVD, a special police unit established in 1934 to destroy any dissidents and opposition to the Bolshevik regime. Since the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1922, the regime consolidated power, ruling with an iron fist. The Communist Party was the only party legally allowed, and anyone seen as a dissident, both within and outside of the party, would be forced to work under horrible conditions in work camps - known as GULAGs under the red government - exploiting and enslaving the people in the name of economic expansion. The sole history of the establishment of the Soviet Union is evidence enough to sentence these criminals to their rightful punishment - death. The communist state led directly to our gruesome Civil War, and our later defeat at the hands of the fascist German menace. It is treason against the Russian nation, on account of incompetence."

What was once a socially liberal party favouring universal suffrage and worker's rights is now considered by many to be a big tent party representing classical and social liberals as well as some moderate conservatives. A tough coalition to maintain, the now-incumbent president Vladimir Nabokov has taken it upon himself to keep the diverse party together for Russia's sake.\n\nAs part of his election campaign, Nabokov has managed to satisfy all three parties by focusing on three simple ideas: International justice, social equality and economic liberty. Ambitious ideas for a divided nation such as Russia, Nabokov will have to maneuver carefully through the virgin landscape of Duma politics if his tenure is to be one that truly champions the rights of man and citizen that he so cherishes."

 russia.45.t:0 "The Status Of Tuva"
 russia.45.d:0 "While the small state of Tuva provides little in regards to resources or people to tax, it was nonetheless a part of China before it broke off following the 1911 Xinhai Revolution. As a former region of China, it is a topic we must now discuss before the conference can come to a close."

 russia.52.t:0 "Russia Offers No Reparations"
 russia.52.d:0 "The Russian Republic seem to be giving us some space after the border changes and have decided against any reparations. Many in our government are demanding some form of compensation, however."
 russia.52.a:0 "Let's just drop the matter then."
 russia.52.b:0 "We need SOMETHING in return dammit!"

 russia.53.t:0 "China Agrees to the Reparations Proposal!"
 russia.53.d:0 "China seems to have agreed with us on the matter of reparations, so we can finally bring an end to the conference."

 russia.57.t:0 "Russia Invades Mongolia!"
 russia.57.d:0 "As per the agreement reached in the border conference, Russia has invaded Mongolia with the intentions of deposing its communist regime."
 russia.57.a:0 "We should help subdue the vile Mongolians."
 russia.57.b:0 "It's just Mongolia, The Russians have it covered."

 russia.58.t:0 "Victory In Mongolia!"
 russia.58.d:0 "As we stand victorious over one of the last remnants of Soviet rule, it's time we addressed Mongolia's future. As the communists have done their damnest to destroy its own culture, we will help them restore their proud people to their former glory. By inviting the Changkya Khutukhtu of Tibetan Buddism to Mongolia, the honorable Lamas can rule over the land once again and bring Mongolia into the cultural renaissance it so craves."
 russia.58.a:0 "How glorious!"

 russia.59.t:0 "Russia Offers Treaty of Protection"
 russia.59.d:0 "The Russian Republic has sent us an offer to protect us in case of foreign invasion from belligerent powers such as Germany and the Toronto Accord. While the gesture is a friendly one, many in our leadership are unsure as to how reliable the Russians will actually be in keeping to their promises."

 russia.62.t:0 "Completion of the Kamchatka Air Base"
 russia.62.d:0 "The Alexander Kolchak Airport has announced its opening in Kamchatka to much fanfare today, serving as the Republic's first domestic airport outside of Vladivostok. Sitting on the important East Siberian junction mere miles away from American Alaska, the airport shall serve as an important junction for American travellers wishing to visit our nation. The prospect of the Kamchatka region seeing unprecedented growth as wealth from people around the world enters such a desolate region."
 russia.62.a:0 "Wonderful!"

 russia.63.t:0 "The Left Consolidates"
 russia.63.d:0 "Ever since the Russian Republic's founding, politicians on the left had for years governed with a mostly free hand under the nation's founding president Alexander Kerensky. During this period of dominance, the SRs built up significant power bases with Yakut miners and rural peasants under a socially-progressive platform promoting worker's rights and agrarian interests. The SRs could not do this alone however, as their more radical counterparts under Isaac Steinberg's Left Socialist-Revolutionaries acted as the left's mouthpiece and muscle in its many disputes with Russia's re-emerging bourgeoisie. While the Left-SRs are seen as too radical by the general public, their role within the labour movement is too important for President Sorokin to ignore.\n\nMeeting with Sinyavsky at the [Root.Capital.GetName] Duma this morning, Sorokin has announced a coalition government with his left-wing counterparts. While this move is one that everyone expected from the new leftist government, what is unknown is how their small support base, of whom many on the right accuse of being crypto-bolshevik, might influence policymaking in the future."
 russia.63.a:0 "Is there power in a union?"

 russia.64.t:0 "A Nation Of Many"
 russia.64.d:0 "To say that the Russian nation is a nation of Russians is completely detached from reality. While the Russian people make up the majority, there are dozens of ethnic groups and faiths who call Russia their home as well. From Turkic peoples such as the Tuvans and Yakut to the Mongolic peoples such as the Buryat and Kalmyk and many more, Russia's diversity is indeed one of the things that makes the Russian nation such an amazing entity.\n\nOur identity as an ethnically and religiously diverse nation is one that Pitirim Sorokin seeks to preserve in the face of Nazi colonialism and reactionary chauvinism. Going forward with the Socialist-Revolutionary platform on minority rights, Russia's status as a federal republic will strive to become something more than just words on a paper. Instead, Russia shall be a true federation of equals united in the common cause of peace, democracy and prosperity."
 russia.64.a:0 "All of Mother Russia's sons shall stand together."

 russia.65.t:0 "March Of The Teachers"
 russia.65.d:0 "The quality of education in Russia has been on the decline ever since the Great Patriotic War shattered the once-great nation. Fed up with the increasing issue of rising illiteracy and outdated faculties, teachers from across Russia have gathered in [Root.Capital.GetName] for a mass-demonstration demanding the Sorokin government increase the wages of educators across the education sector and funding for public schools.\n\nWhile the demonstration was peaceful and eventually died down as the day ended, it would appear that everyone across the country agree with the protestors, and that the government must act decisively so as to prevent Russia from falling behind the rest of the world."
 russia.65.a:0 "Education is a right, it is time we deliver."

 russia.66.t:0 "Father Of The Nation"
 russia.66.d:0 ""It was Alexander Kerensky that stood against Lenin's Bolshevik gangsters and tyrannical Tsarists. It was Alexander Kerensky that brought Russia out from the abyss of anarchy and poverty into the light of liberal democracy and prosperity. Alexander Kerensky, Father Of The Nation, was brutally slain by fascist assassins who tried and failed to bring his greatest achievement back down into the depths of hell. While Russians everywhere mourn his unexpected and tragic passing, it is important that the Motherland's children never forget the values of which he instilled in a once-broken people."\n\n\n- Excerpt from an elementary school history book"
 russia.66.a:0 "We will never forget our nation's greatest father!"

 russia.67.t:0 "A State For All"
 russia.67.d:0 "By far the largest socioeconomic group in Russia is the lower-class worker and peasant. Once ruthlessly exploited by the crimnal Reds, the Socialist-Revolutionary new voter bloc are by far the most influential voice in Russian politics. With the principles of Alexander Kerensky and other progressive politicians, the SR cause has become one of helping all its people prosper with a state that provides what the masses need. This "Just Deal" inspired by the Social Democratic movements in Britain and Sweden proposed by Pitirim Sorokin are just the ticket believed to achieve this goal.\n\nAn extensive plan, the Just Deal covers an extensive list of proposed reforms and government-sponsored construction projects aimed at building up Russia's industry and infrastructure while providing benefits for workers and peasants that otherwise were left in the dark by previous administrations. While Kerensky was never able to put this plan into effect, Pitirm Sorokin now has the opportunity to finally finish what had been started all the way back in 1917."
 russia.67.a:0 ""A government for the people" shall take on a new meaning."

 russia.68.t:0 "The Expansion Of Vladivostok Port"
 russia.68.d:0 "Vladivostok has been and continues to be Russia's door to Pacific trade. While the dockyards of the Russian Republic have grown busier over the years, it is painfully obvious that the antiquated port was by no means built for the traffic of an increasingly-globalized market. In an announcement made by local Vladivostok officials, the great port of the East will be refurbished and expanded to allow for greater flow of cargo to and from Russia.\n\nA move celebrated by all, there is no doubt that Russia's future as a world leader in trade and finance is looking brighter now in spite of all the suffering of the past decades."
 russia.68.a:0 "The gates of the world open for the Russian bear."

 russia.69.t:0 "The Communes Of New Russia"
 russia.69.d:0 "While the Bolsheviks of old made the error of collectivizing the land of peasants, the SRs have instead opted for a program of socialisation and pragmatic communes. These new communes operate on a system devoid of landlordism and a more progressive form of Land Value Tax. Appearing on newspapers sympathetic towards the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, a model commune showing happy peasants toiling on rich land of which they truly own captivates its idalistic readers.\n\nThis new policy is one of the main tenants of the Just Deal put forward years before by Russia's top leftist minds, and is proving to be extremely popular among a peasantry whose land had once simply exchanged landlords with the state decades ago."
 russia.69.a:0 "All men shall own the land on which they live."

 russia.70.t:0 "Inaugaration of Grigory Pomerants"
 russia.70.d:0 "As the Far-East Crisis finally winds down, former Kadety MP and philospher Grigory Pomerants has been confirmed as new President following a snap election sponsored by the US Government. A staunch social liberal, Pomerants has expressed a desire to bring the free nations of Europe into a grand alliance to bring down the Nazi blight on the continent. As the nation he now presides over is broken economically and socially by the assassination of Anatoly Rogozhin, however, it seems as if the work cut out for him and his new party will make this dream happen later rather than sooner."
 russia.70.a:0 "The Presidency...at what cost?"

 russia.71.t:0 "A New Economic Policy"
 russia.71.d:0 "Despsite the formation of Russian Revival from the ashes of the Kadet Party, we will still have to placate many of the old party's more conservative members. As the economic crisis remains at the top of the mind of everyone in the nation, there are those in the cabinet that are encouraging Pomerants to reach across the aisle and co-operate with Pasternak's opposition in forming a proper economic recovery plan. We can, of course, choose not to cooperate with the conservatives and go into it alone."
 russia.71.a:0 "Russia needs bipartisanship now more than ever."
 russia.71.b:0 "Pomerants alone will fix the economy!"

 russia.72.t:0 "Europe, United and Divided"
 russia.72.d:0 "The European continent has been torn to shreds by years of Nazi occupation, with millions being whisked away with the stroke of a pen and others toiling away in work camps across occupied Russia. Not all is gloomy in Europe however, as many nations have escaped the horrors of war or stand opposed to Hitler and his goonies. It is therefore the duty of all free men of Europe and the world to come together and bring Germania down once and for all. To bring about this righteous war against totalitarianism, Russia must lead the way as a beacon of European freedom and liberty."
 russia.72.a:0 ""National Socialism" will be a thing of the past soon enough."

 russia.73.t:0 "A Message From Russia"
 russia.73.d:0 "While Russia has been in a state of anarchy for years, however the Russian Republic has stood out as one of the major remnants. Knowing full-well of our strained relationship with our former German allies, the Russian President has sent us a curious request for opening trade with the troubled nation. While this could undoubtedly benefit us in the future, such a move might upset our neighbours to the north quite noticeably."
 russia.73.a:0 "We have a friend in Russia."
 russia.73.b:0 "They wouldn't stand a chance against [GER.GetLeader] anyways."

 russia.74.t:0 "Italy Accepts!"
 russia.74.d:0 "It seems that the Italian government has seen wisdom and have agreed to open trade with us."
 russia.74.a:0 "Nice."

 russia.75.t:0 "Italy Declines!"
 russia.75.d:0 "Unfortunately, Italy has decided not to open trade with us."
 russia.75.a:0 "Dang."

 russia.76.t:0 "Join the European Union?"
 russia.76.d:0 "Citing the threat posed by Germany, the Russian Republic has invited us to join their new European alliance aimed at containing and vanquishing the Nazis. This "European Union" also hopes to act as a future power bloc promoting the ideas of liberal democracy and freedom for all."
 russia.76.a:0 "Sure."
 russia.76.b:0 "It isn't for us."

 russia.77.t:0 "To Revive A Nation..."
 russia.77.d:0 "The Russian nation is a shadow of its former self. The people are divided among arbitrary warlordist lines, while millions others toil away under dictatorial occupiers seeking to colonize rightful Russian land. If Russia is to survive as a nation and rejoin the world it will have to rebuild itself from the ground-up in all aspects of culture, the economy and administration."
 russia.77.a:0 "A Russian cultural revolution?"

 russia.78.t:0 "University of Khabarovsk Founded"
 russia.78.d:0 "The funding of higher education was one of Pomerants' biggest goals upon being elected to office. As pre-existing universities get more funding, the need for newer and better institutes has spurred the government to open a new university in Khabarovsk. Personally visiting the ceremonial opening, President Pomerants gave a grand speech about his desire to turn Russia into a new land that promotes the absolute nature of science, learning and logic. The new university specializes in engineering and Russian language studies.\n\nAs Russia gradually comes together under the leadership of Pomerants, some believe that one day Russia may even rival the United States in mathematics and science."
 russia.78.a:0 "Progress stops for no man!"

 russia.79.t:0 "President Pomerants Meets Great Patriotic War Veterans"
 russia.79.d:0 "In a staged media spectacle in [Root.Capital.GetName] today, Grigory Pomerants has met with ten veterans from the Great Patriotic War. Having deserted the Red Army and fled east when the Soviet government fell apart, Pomerants praised the men for their valliant struggle against the Wehrmacht and their decision to join the side of freedom for all Russians.\n\nThe men were given the highest honours that exist in the Russian Republic: The Order of Kerensky. As the day went on, pictures of the president having a lavish feast with the veterans circulated across Russia as Pomerants seems to be reaching out to conservative voters by tying himself in with the military and his government's never-ending struggle against the Hun."
 russia.79.a:0 "Their deeds shall be immortal for all time."

 russia.80.t:0 "A Friend Of Zion"
 russia.80.d:0 "Just as Kerensky before him, the plight of the Jewish people has always been one that President Sorokin sympathizes with. As Der Sturmer routinely churns out hateful bile in Germania, the Russian Democratic Federative Republic has from its inception sought to mend the wounds caused by the Russian governments of old and the Nazi regime of today. In his latest move to further strengthen his ties with the Republic's Jewish community, Sorokin visited a group of Jewish farmers in Permskoye with a group of excited journalists not far behind.\n\nTaking a leisurely stroll through the farm's vast fields, Sorokin was seen having a chat with a farmer about crop prices and life on their newly-socialized property. Knowing fully well that a reporter from TTA was within earshot, Sorokin went to plant wheat seeds with the help of a young boy before standing tall and proudly declaring his support for future generations of Jewish men and women.\n\nSorokin did not stay long at the farm, and before he left he had some of his aids buy a goat from them for their troubles. Jokingly nicknamed "Vera" by the press, the relationship between Sorokin and his newfound friends in the Jewish community seem unbreakable now."
 russia.80.a:0 "Does the presidential goat bite, though?"
 
 rus_elec.1.t:0 "Religion in Russia"
 rus_elec.1.d:0 "Russia is a land of many faiths. From the Orthodox Christian majority, to the Jews of Ulan Ude and the west, to the Muslims of Tatarstan and Central Asia, and even the Buddhist Kalmyks, one truly cannot deny that Russia is a place of faith - in more ways than one, for sure. However, under the Soviets, most religions were suppressed in the name of Marxist atheism. This was a deeply unpopular decision, and though it was reversed during the war, it was not enough to save the nation from destruction by the Germans.\n\nWith the birth of a new republic, the issue of religion has, as elsewhere in the world, been a contentious one. Some favour a French-style policy of laïcité - in short, freedom of religion, as well as freedom from religion. Others, primarily on the right, have said the opposite, arguing that the history of the Orthodox Church is one with the history of Russia, and should be taught about. In the middle of the debate are fairly simple secularists, supporting the right to freedom of religion as thought of first by Kerensky."
 rus_elec.1.a:0 "Freedom of religion? What about freedom from religion?"
 rus_elec.1.b:0 "Russia is made up of Christians, Jews, Muslims, and many others."
 rus_elec.1.c:0 "The Orthodox Church is integral to the Russian way of life."
 
 rus_elec.2.t:0 "The Treatment of Jews"
 rus_elec.2.d:0 "Though we are fortunately nowhere near the level of antisemitism as the Germans, Russia's history with Jews remains somewhat... complicated. Under the Empire, there were the infamous pogroms and the Black Hundreds, as well as the policy of serfdom. With the abolition of the Pale of Settlement, to which Jews were limited, by Kerensky, a short-lived time of philosemitism dawned on Russia, before the darkest chapter in history. Thousands, if not millions, of Jews were killed by Petliura's Ukrainian nationalists and Russians on both sides during the Civil War. And then, when the Soviet Union took power, things got slightly better - but the hostility by the gentile leadership against Jews remained.\n\nWith the re-establishment of Kerensky's government in Vladivostok, a policy of support for the Jewry has returned to Russia. Included in the constitution were the rights of minorities, specifically including Jews, and Kerensky was a notorious supporter of Zionism and Judaism prior to his killing. With the new elections, every side has been quick to accuse one another of antisemitism, claiming that only they can truly help the Jewish community of Russia. How should the rights of Jews be addressed in a new republic?"
 rus_elec.2.a:0 "Jewish rights must be furthered. We are better than the Germans."
 rus_elec.2.b:0 "Now, I don't hate Jews, but I'm just saying..."
 
 rus_elec.3.t:0 "Building a Better Federation"
 rus_elec.3.d:0 "Russia is a big country, filled with many Russians. Throughout history, many leaders, most famously Alexander II, have tried to devolve powers to local authorities, while others, such as Stalin, have followed a policy of centralisation. Under Kerensky's constitution, Russia was federalised along governorates (today known as oblasts). Under the Soviets, Russia was de jure federal, but de facto heavily centralised around the party.\n\nThe vastness of Russia, though many areas remain low in population, has only become more apparent with our return. Russia is the largest country on Earth, and while America and other countries have such things as heavy industrialism allowing them to get from, say, New York to Los Angeles without much trouble, such a thing is not present in the desolate, impoverished wastes of free Russia, despite all the Toronto Accord aid. Some have said federalism is the answer to make Russia easier to govern, while others claim it would inspire separatism and only further divide our shattered motherland. What's the way to go in this case?"
 rus_elec.3.a:0 "Federalism is good - further decentralisation would allow for more freedom."
 rus_elec.3.b:0 "We need to continue working towards federalism as Kerensky imagined."
 rus_elec.3.c:0 "The current federal system is not ideal, and could use some tweaking."
 
 rus_elec.4.t:0 "The Status of Indigenous Peoples"
 rus_elec.4.d:0 "Despite many people's disinterest in the history of Siberian natives, their history is vast and long, including many interactions both with Chinese empires and Russian explorers, such as Pavlutskiy's brutal expeditions against the Chukchi. With the entrance of American and Canadian influence, the history of the indigenous Siberians has been coined as Russia's own "Trail of Tears" - the forced relocation and killings of countless Native Americans throughout the 1800s and 1900s.\n\nWhile the republic guarantees equality to them on paper, things remain tough for native Siberians, and our limited control over the nation has only served to highlight their problems. Poverty remains rampant, as does, to an extent, discrimination. Some have argued that the best way to go about this is ethnic aid, while some more chauvinistic voices claim that this would be too expensive, and they must integrate into Russian society. The discussion has brought forth a number of ideas, and it seems like many parties have taken sides. How can the indigenous Siberians best be helped?"
 rus_elec.4.a:0 "They must be given aid, and we should respect their culture."
 rus_elec.4.b:0 "Poverty is an issue among them especially, and they need aid."
 rus_elec.4.c:0 "They isolate themselves from us, and now they want aid? Ha!"
 
 rus_elec.5.t:0 "Capitalism: Right or Wrong?"
 rus_elec.5.d:0 "The discussion of capitalism in Russia has proven to be intensely controversial in the short few decades that it has been discussed. It has led to three revolutions, two American invasions of the Far East, a civil war, and the total collapse of the country. Indeed, it seems like both old Tsarist feudalism, as well as Soviet communism, have brought misfortune to Russia.\n\nThat leaves only capitalism, ranging from laissez-faire to Keynesian. Both have their own purported flaws and benefits. And then, against both of that is a sort of "patriotic protectionism" peddled by the Octobrists, curtailing the excesses of capitalism whilst not moving into socialism. The debate has been reignited - though thankfully, at a more peaceful level than the terroristic madness of the late Tsarist period."
 rus_elec.5.a:0 "Protectionism will save our economy from foreign influences."
 rus_elec.5.b:0 "Socialism is good, but we must pursue it in moderation."
 rus_elec.5.c:0 "Capitalism is the way of freedom, and it shall be our way."
 
 rus_elec.6.t:0 "Farmland or Factories?"
 rus_elec.6.d:0 "Many in Russia, and especially in the Far East, live in rural areas. For generations, many Russians have tilled the land, working as farmers. With the Industrial Revolution and its aftermath, a trend of rapid industrialisation began, something only accelerated by the Soviet seizure of power. And while some would argue that the Industrial Revolution has been a disaster for Russia, it is certainly not going away any time soon.\n\nAs to what extent Russia should focus on further industrialisation remains debated though. Traditionalists have argued that there is a need to put further emphasis on agrarianism, while modernists have claimed that there is a need to support construction of further factories, both for foreign and domestic companies. Of course, we could always focus on both, as well. How should Russia face this challenge?"
 rus_elec.6.a:0 "Rampant industrialisation will come crashing down some day."
 rus_elec.6.b:0 "We must balance industrialism and agrarianism."
 rus_elec.6.c:0 "Industrialism will create a modern Russia."
 
 rus_elec.7.t:0 "The Question of Welfare"
 rus_elec.7.d:0 "In the postwar period, with millions without homes or proper healthcare, and the worldwide shift to the leftwards (excluding some places), the idea of a welfare system has become incredibly popular. Some have taken inspiration from the Swedish idea of "folkhemmet" - people's home, guaranteeing such things as welfare, free education, and many other things. One place that this has been felt is the United Kingdom, under the government of Clement Attlee.\n\nWith our close relationship to the United Kingdom (as with the rest of the Toronto Accord), we have also felt the waves of this. In Russia, it is a greater problem than anywhere else - our infrastructure is, in many places, non-existent, and millions have been left as dead or refugees from Stalinism and Germany's crimes against humanity in the occupied territories. Others, however, argue that socialised welfare will soon lead to a socialised society - the same sort of communism that once afflicted this land. What's the way to go for Russia's welfare?"
 rus_elec.7.a:0 "We need welfare now, absolutely."
 rus_elec.7.b:0 "I don't support welfare, but social security is good."
 rus_elec.7.c:0 "This will only hike taxes and support laziness."
 
 rus_elec.8.t:0 "Our Relationship With America"
 rus_elec.8.d:0 "Russo-American relations are long, as old as America itself. And, although with some tumultuous periods throughout history, one cannot dispute that they have been primarily friendly. Russia under Catherine the Great supported the United States in their war of independence, and Alexander II supported the Americans during their Civil War - the only European leader to do so. American troops fought alongside the Whites in the Civil War, and though Russia and the United States did not fight together in the Second World War, we both have a common enemy - the Germans.\n\nHowever, among some Russians, there is a growing anti-Americanism in favour of other possible allies. In the opinion of these people, the Americans, and the west in general, are decadent and have not done enough to fight fascism. At the same time, according to anti-American advocates, Americans simultaneously accuse Russians of problems that America has itself - such as supposed Russian "backwardness" while they are (allegedly) lynching blacks. What shall the next Russian government's opinion on America be?"
 rus_elec.8.a:0 "America is a good ally, and we can trust them."
 rus_elec.8.b:0 "America is our greatest ally."
 rus_elec.8.c:0 "America is decadent and corrupt."

While our nation remains in disarray, we are, at the very least, returning to a sense of normalcy in our shattered motherland.\n\nRussia has come far. It seems that finally, the cycle of democracy being taken for granted by terrorists and autocrats has come to an end. Kerensky, once seen as a dismal failure by émigrés and mainland Russians alike, redeemed himself with the formation of a Russian democracy - only to be killed by the fascists who sought refuge in Manchuria just before he could see elections. People around Russia tune in to the news to hear the results on the radio, many for the first time.\n\n"Today, parliamentary elections have been held for the first time since 1949.

 rus_elec.13.b:0 "Boris Pasternak and Vtoroye Rozhdeniye!"

 ivanomika.1.t:0 "The Peasants' Revolt!"
 ivanomika.1.d:0 "Disturbing news from our borderland regions, as dissatisfied Russian peasants have taken up arms against us! These groups of armed peasants and workers have been spurred into action by years of neglect by our government, and might even attempt to usurp state rule altogether."
 ivanomika.1.a:0 "We will crush this "revolution.""
 
 ivanomika.2.t:0 "Completion of the Kolyma Route"
 ivanomika.2.d:0 "It had been a tireless project. Building a modern highway in the Siberian wastes with limited funds and manpower was a tight project already, hampered only by years of government instability that only until very recently was resolved. Nicknamed the "Highway Of Bones" by its workers due to the high mortality rate, the fruits of their labour will hopefully pay off as the nation's furthest reaches are finally connected to the modern world."
 ivanomika.2.a:0 "Their sacrifice will be worth it."
 
 ivanomika.3.t:0 "The Matter of Gaming"
 ivanomika.3.d:0 "One of the most sensitive issues with the re-empowered Orthodox church is the various moral issues plaguing the Republic. Ever since Vladivostok was liberated from the clutches of Bolshevism and anarchy, illicit gambling and prostitution have run rampant in the city's vast criminal underbelly. The gaming industry in Russia could serve as an economic bonus for the state however, if we force the shady casino owners and the like into operating in a special "Red Light" district in Vladivostok they can be regulated easier. While listening to the patriarch would gain a lot of support from the church, the economic potential for becoming a "Russian Shanghai" are hard to ignore."
 ivanomika.3.a:0 "The patriarch is right, gaming must end."
 ivanomika.3.b:0 "A bit of regulation should put them in their place."
 
 ivanomika.4.t:0 "The Electrification of Northeastern Siberia"
 ivanomika.4.d:0 "The furthest reaches of Siberia are without a doubt the most technologically backwards in all of Russia. While most of Russia chugs along the wheels of progress and modernity, many settlements and villages across its cold wastes don't even have running water or electricity. Today, the Russian government has announced a mass-electrification campaign for northeastern Siberia's most isolated villages. Already, photos of fascinated villagers experiencing the modern luxuries of electrical appliances and even telephones have sparked the imagination of ordinary city-dwellers and investors alike."
 ivanomika.4.a:0 "The train of progress finally reached its station."
 
 ivanomika.5.t:0 "Enlargement of the Magadan Seaport"
 ivanomika.5.d:0 "Trade from across the Pacific Ocean is one of the Republic's greatest lifelines, and it has been unfortunately neglected for years. To curb this unnecessary rot, we have expanded and refurbished the famous Magadan seaport to accommodate an increase in imports and exports from the resource-rich far east. This will undoubtedly accelerate Russia's push into the international community!\n\nHowever, a small dispute has broken out over the name. Philaret requests that it be christened after Saint Peter, while more nationalistic members of the Troika have brought up the possibility of naming it in memory of the great Admiral Kolchak."
 ivanomika.5.a:0 "Christen it after Saint Peter!"
 ivanomika.5.b:0 "Name it in memory of Admiral Kolchak!"
 
 ivanomika.6.t:0 "Expansion of Yakut Coalmining"
 ivanomika.6.d:0 "The great region of Yakutia is one of our greatest resource-rich states that Russia can provide, as her diamond and coal mines contain a vast deposit of wealth just begging to be exploited. With a growing workforce and demand for Yakutia's vast resources, it is finally time that we expanded their mining operations to accommodate the unprecedented sharp rise in demand for raw materials."
 ivanomika.6.a:0 "Even the Yakuts can do their part for Russia!"
 
 ivanomika.7.t:0 "Extending the Trans-Siberian"
 ivanomika.7.d:0 "The Trans-Siberian Railway has been a hallmark of Russia's influence in the Far East ever since it was completed in 1904. An extremely important junction during the Russian Civil War and the USSR's collapse in the mid-1940s, its importance continues to remain indisputable today. Hoping to extend this influence to the farthest reaches of our great Republic, we will fund projects to extend the railway's lines all the way into the furthest reaches of Siberia."
 ivanomika.7.a:0 "All of Russia shall be connected."
 
 ivanomika.8.t:0 "Private Schooling in Chita"
 ivanomika.8.d:0 "The state of Chita had only until recently gone under proper government control, and already the old social issues have reared their ugly head. Many Orthodox Christian groups in the region have established private schools. While this is, of course, good, especially given Chita's lack of education even among the wastes of Russia, we would normally not have a problem. However, there's one problem: we don't know what these schools are teaching. For all we know, it could be a load of anti-government bull. While we could force all education in the state to come under government supervision, we could also let these private schools operate on their own, and throw their own money away."
 ivanomika.8.a:0 "Only the state can dictate education."
 ivanomika.8.b:0 "These schools are promising, let them operate."
 
 ivanomika.9.t:0 "Welfare for the Poor"
 ivanomika.9.d:0 "One of the largest issues facing the Republic at all avenues is that of poverty. From north to south and east to west, many Russians frequently worry about getting enough food in the mouths or having a roof to sleep under. This is something that Ivan Mikhailov and his government find simply unacceptable. There are two main ways we can solve this issue: We can either create a somewhat-extensive welfare program so that the poor can get sufficient living conditions like all Russians, or we can rely on the church's charity projects to alleviate the woes of the poor. "
 ivanomika.9.a:0 "We must help those who cannot help themselves."
 ivanomika.9.b:0 "Alleviate church taxes so that they can better assist the poor."
 
 ivanomika.10.t:0 "Completion of the Baikal-Pacific Pipeline"
 ivanomika.10.d:0 "Oil is the lifeblood of every modern industrialized nation, and Russia is anything but an exception to this. Beliving in the power of oil, the government has announced the completion of the Baikal-Pacific Pipeline: An oil pipeline for Siberia's vast oil reserves stretching across the hills of Outer Manchuria to Vladivostok for processing."
 ivanomika.10.a:0 "Oil is our gold!"
 
 ivanomika.11.t:0 "Shaken, Not Stirred"
 ivanomika.11.d:0 "Alcohol is one of humanity's greatest vices, and in Russia it is one that's widespread amongst its population. The impact of endemic alcoholism on the population and their work ethic has become increasingly noticeable over the years, and even the Orthodox Patriarch of Russia has demanded that our government take action in this so-called "War on the Bottle"."
 ivanomika.11.a:0 "A little taxes never hurt anyone."
 ivanomika.11.b:0 "Alcohol is part of our culture!"
 
 ivanomika.12.t:0 "The Vladivostok Vodka Riot"
 ivanomika.12.d:0 "Following our implementation of increased taxes on alcoholic products, many people within our republic have expressed their discontent in various ways. However, it seems that things have taken a violent turn. In the midst of an anti-tax protest today in Vladivostok, an outbreak of violence began due to reasons not yet clear, leading to a large riot with millions of rubles in damages. Three people have been killed, and twelve hospitalised with serious injuries. Many participants in the riots have already been arrested, but it is thought that many more remain on the run."
 ivanomika.12.a:0 "All that for a drop of liquor..."

 ivanomika.13.t:0 "The GULAG Archipelago"
 ivanomika.13.d:0 "The lands of the former Soviet Union are home to many GULAGs - originally short for "Chief Administration of the Camps", the abbreviation has come to refer to the camps themselves. Established on the orders of Lenin, they reached their peak as Stalin cracked down on all opposition to his rule. However, now that we are in charge, we have an opportunity; to abolish the GULAGs completely, as many moderate members of our government are calling for, or to repurpose them on prisoners, communists, and other opponents to our rule. What path should we pursue?"
 ivanomika.13.a:0 "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
 ivanomika.13.b:0 "We are better than the communists."
 
 ivanomika.14.t:0 "Yenisei Dam Completed"
 ivanomika.14.d:0 "Thankfully, after much hard work and money going into the project, it appears that we have completed our planned damming of the Yenisei river. With this, we have completed in important step of our republic's economic modernisation, and harnessed the powerful waters of Siberia in the name of progress."
 ivanomika.14.a:0 "Excellent!"
 
 ivanomika.15.t:0 "Norilsk Nickel Mines Expanded"
 ivanomika.15.d:0 "The state directive expanding the nickel mines outside the city of Norilsk, begun following our liberation of the great north, has officially announced that it has completed work today. With this, we shall be able to expand our extraction of resources for the economic benefit of our motherland. Some have voiced concern at the possibility of negative environmental impact. However, we are certain that these are just leftist-Stilyagi seeking to undermine the prosperity of our motherland!"
 ivanomika.15.a:0 "Ey ukhnem, ey ukhnem..."
 
 ivanomika.16.t:0 "Norilsk Iron Mines Expanded"
 ivanomika.16.d:0 "The state directive expanding the iron mines outside the city of Norilsk, begun following our liberation of the great north, has officially announced that it has completed work today. With this, we shall be able to expand our extraction of resources for the economic benefit of our motherland. Some have voiced concern at the possibility of negative environmental impact. However, we are certain that these are just leftist-Stilyagi seeking to undermine the prosperity of our motherland!"
 ivanomika.16.a:0 "Ey ukhnem, ey ukhnem..."

 ivanomika.17.t:0 "Norilsk's Legacy"
 ivanomika.17.d:0 "Old Norilsk was filled with various dissidents that opposed Mikhailov and any real authority figure for years, however now we will have to finally deal with them. The philaret has urged for leniency on many of these men, as many of them are priests or simply political prisoners who will do zero harm to the regime. They are nonetheless criminals though, and we needn't be reminded of the dangers that letting even one violent one escape the jaws of justice. "
 ivanomika.17.a:0 "They should be free men."
 ivanomika.17.b:0 "We can't take any chances, lock them up."

 ivanomika.18.t:0 "Famine and Sausage"
 ivanomika.18.d:0 "The prospect of starvation is not new to the Russian people, especially in the chaos following the Soviet Union's collapse in the far East. Rations in this period were more often than not what is known as a "Doctor's Sausage", a special variety of low-fat bologna made to be cheap to produce and distribute in times of famine. Considered to be very healthy, the Doctor's Sausage remains extremely popular among the Russian people even as living conditions improve.\n\nThese sorts of rations are made of almost pure pork however, and many Russians are unable to consume them for religious reasons. The Organization of Russian Meat Corporations is pressing the government to pursue new avenues of rations for all Russians, however diversifying rations could not only be costly but unpopular with the majority who currently enjoy the sausages. "
 ivanomika.18.a:0 "We can just make a new sausage without pork."
 ivanomika.18.b:0 "A nation can't live on only sausages! We should develop new rations."

 ivanomika.19.t:0 "Kazakhs: Allies Or Enemies?"
 ivanomika.19.d:0 "The Kazakh peoples have a complicated history with Russia. Decades of mistrust due to Russification policies and economic mismanagement have left Kazakhstan understandably quite resentful of returning to Soviet rule. As we now control the lands that once constituted the the Kazakh SSR, we have the unique opportunity to reshape Kazakhstan as we see fit.\n\nAn established autonomous republic would be very popular with the locals, however it may be more beneficial for us to administer the land directly as the region's former pan-Turkic madmen are still at large across the region."
 ivanomika.19.a:0 "An autonomous republic will serve them well."
 ivanomika.19.b:0 "Direct rule from [Root.Capital.GetName] should keep them in line."

 ivanomika.20.t:0 "Foundation of the Kazakh SAR"
 ivanomika.20.d:0 "Earlier today, people across Kazakhstan celebrate the founding of their own autonomous state. While Kazakhstan is still privy to laws from [Root.Capital.GetName], the Kazakh region can dictate its own internal affairs with varying degrees of freedom. Liberal voices across the nation hail the move as a step towards reconciliation with Central Asia, while others seem content that the threat of terrorism posed by Turkestani sympathizers might finally be gone."
 ivanomika.20.a:0 "The Kazakh people are strong!"

 ivanomika.21.t:0 "An Attack In Alma-ata!"
 ivanomika.21.d:0 "At 8:23AM this morning, a massive blast rocked the Kazakh capital of Alma-ata. The bomb in question completely flattened a Russian police station, killing 62. Later that day as security forces were picking up the pieces, a terrorist group calling itself "Irgetas" (Foundation) claimed responsibility for the attack. Demanding a bloody jihad against the "Russian occupiers", Irgetas has vowed to ramp up its war in the region for the time being. The news comes as a shock to few, as the seeds of Salafi ideology had been present in the region for many years now.\n\nThe only question now is, how can a war on terrorism be fought in a nation trying to heal its own wounds?"
 ivanomika.21.a:0 "Is our very way of life under attack?" 

 ivanomika.22.t:0 "Of Traitors and Men"
 ivanomika.22.d:0 "Not all Russians under Nazi occupation resisted. Many turned to organizations such as the Russian Liberation Army and its various off-shoots seeking varying goals such as defeating communism or simply to save their own skin. The status of these collaborators are heavily debated within the government, and many see them as nothing more than traitors deserving of a traitor's death. There is however much to be said for forgiveness and turning the other cheek, as The Good Book often says."
 ivanomika.22.a:0 "They are deserving of a second chance."
 ivanomika.22.b:0 "Thus unto traitors!"

 ivanomika.23.t:0 "Correctional Labour For Communists?"
 ivanomika.23.d:0 "The glorious victory over the Soviet Union's pathetic remnants has left us with a multitude of people that once sympathized or worked with the old communist regime. These sorts of ideas are naturally poisonous for our society, and those that committed such horrid acts of barbarism in the name of Lenin The Bastard should atone for their crimes. The question is, just how should these people be dealt with?"
 ivanomika.23.a:0 "Time in their own GULAGs will suffice quite nicely."
 ivanomika.23.b:0 "Keep them under strict surveillance."

 ivanomika.24.t:0 "The Status Of Education"
 ivanomika.24.d:0 "The former Soviet education system is inredibly flawed, and teaches many falsehoods about communism and the regime's revered dictators. As the education system of the old Perm government gradually integrates itself into the Russian Republic's, the question of makinng a brand new curriculum is one that many in the Department of Education now highly recommend."
 ivanomika.24.a:0 "A new curriculum is needed for a new Russia."
 ivanomika.24.b:0 "Just cross out references to Marx and it'll be fine."

 ivanomika.25.t:0 "Farming in the Steppes"
 ivanomika.25.d:0 "Kazakhstan is a vast, sparsely-populated land. Ideal for new farming projects, as many in the Agricultural Ministry tells us. As our control of the region becomes permanent, it will be important to determine just how this land and its future riches will be distributed. Centralizing agriculture under [Root.Capital.GetName] will allow us to keep the profits to ourselves right away, however leaving it in the hands of local oblasts might be more beneficial in the long run as local administrators could maximize profit as the land becomes more developed in the future."
 ivanomika.25.a:0 "We need the money now, centralize it!"
 ivanomika.25.b:0 "Good things come to those that wait, let the Kazakhs handle this."

 ivanomika.26.t:0 "Decentralize Electricity?"
 ivanomika.26.d:0 "The power grids that kept the former Soviet Union powered are now in our hands. While much of the technology was incompatible with ours, there is a possibility that we can adapt our existing infrastructure to Perm's so power lines from Vladivostok to Perm can hook up. This centralization project would understandably be quite costly, however the benefits are hard to ignore."
 ivanomika.26.a:0 "We should keep it decentralized."
 ivanomika.26.b:0 "A united Russia shall have a united power grid!"

 ivanomika.27.t:0 "Lessons From the Red Army"
 ivanomika.27.d:0 "The Red Army has over the years developed a variety of tactics in the art of warfare as their situation constantly changed. One area they especially excelled in was the tactics of guerrilla warfare, one which had proven its effectiveness during the Reichskommissariats collapse of 1953. Our army however is constantly changing as well, and such tactics might not be suited for a modern professional army."
 ivanomika.27.a:0 "What is there to learn from an army that lost?"
 ivanomika.27.b:0 "Guerrilla warfare should be taught at the academy, for sure."

 ivanomika.28.t:0 "The Hunt"
 ivanomika.28.d:0 "Hunting has been popular in Russia for centuries. Once a tradition of Russia's indigenous peoples, it evolved into a sport that Russians of all classes could enjoy during the Soviet years. As the old hunting lodges were left rotting by the wars, the question of what to do with the classic pastime of many Russians is left lingering.\n\nWhile the thrill of the hunt is undeniably popular, the thought of giving the people guns that they might turn against our government is one that concerns the President's advisors greatly."
 ivanomika.28.a:0 "The lodges shall reopen!"
 ivanomika.28.b:0 "We can't afford the risk of an armed people."

 ivanomika.29.t:0 "The Standoff Against The Germans"
 ivanomika.29.d:0 "As the free zones of Russia are once again in our grasp, the matter of the German threat to the west of the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line is present now more than ever. In preparation for the inevitable Second Great Patriotic War, the War Department has recommended two different plans:\n\nWe could fortify the Ural Mountains to withstand a German assault, or formalize the National Redoubt Directive; a general list of orders and protocols designed to let our frontline soldiers be able to stand their ground against the Reich's ungodly onslaught."
 ivanomika.29.a:0 "The Urals must be fortified!"
 ivanomika.29.b:0 "Not one step back! The Redoubt will go into effect."

 ivanomika.30.t:0 "Autonomy In the Caucasus?"
 ivanomika.30.d:0 "The Caucasus region of Russia is home to dozens of ethnic groups living in an extremely-delicate balance with the Russian government. As we re-assert our control over this region, the question of how our policy with its people going forward will dictate how its people will accustom to the return of Russian rule."
 ivanomika.30.a:0 "Let the people there govern themselves, it'll be easier."
 ivanomika.30.b:0 "Russian administrators will better oversee the Caucasus' reintegration."

 ivanomika.31.t:0 "Foundation Of the Chechen Congress"
 ivanomika.31.d:0 "In an announcement over Grozny radio this morning, a group of Jihadist separatists declared the founding of the "United Chechen Congress", a militant organization aimed at ridding Chechnya of its "infidel invaders" and a full restoration of Chechen independence that it once enjoyed after the Reichskommissariat Kaukasus collapsed in 1953. While its numbers a rumoured to be relatively small in number, its actions so far are certainly not.\n\nA mere hour after the announcement, a group of armed Chechen rebels stormed Grozny City Hall and allegedly massacred the Russian mayor and his staff. As the occupation of the building went on throughout the day, the army eventually retook the city hall with all occupants inside either dead or arrested. This could be the spark of a long, brutal insurgency for years to come."
 ivanomika.31.a:0 "The prestine mountains will run red."

 ivanomika.32.t:0 "The Status of the Transcaucasus"
 ivanomika.32.d:0 "The lands of Armenia and Georgia were once territories of the Russian Empire. Throughout the years however, they have frequently declared their own independence once the Russian nation was in a state of grave crisis. Just as in 1917 as was in 1945, these nation-states now lay on the border of a new Russia, one that is torn on reintegrating these valuable nations again or adopting a more pragmatic approach."
 ivanomika.32.a:0 "We will request an alliance with Armenia and Georgia."
 ivanomika.32.b:0 "The Russian flag will fly in Tiblsi and Yerevan soon enough!"

 ivanomika.33.t:0 "Arrival of the Russian Delegation"
 ivanomika.33.d:0 "The Russian Republic has approached us with an interesting proposal for an alliance. Once our occupier, it would seem that Russia and its leader suddenly have an interest in friendship instead of conquest. The question is, can we trust the Russians?"
 ivanomika.33.a:0 "United we are stronger!"
 ivanomika.33.b:0 "We can't trust the Russians."

 ivanomika.34.t:0 "[ROOT] Agrees to an Alliance!"
 ivanomika.34.d:0 "Seeing the wisdom in our request, [ROOT] has accepted our offer of an alliance."
 ivanomika.34.a:0 "Nice."

 ivanomika.35.t:0 "[ROOT] Refuses an Alliance!"
 ivanomika.35.d:0 "Unfortunately, [ROOT]'s government clearly isn't logical as they have requested our offer of alliance and friendship."
 ivanomika.35.a:0 "Their loss."

 ivanomika.36.t:0 "The Muslims of the Mountains"
 ivanomika.36.d:0 "The mountainous region of the Caucasus is home to many people, much of whom are Islamic. While this alone does not pose a threat, there are those in the government that see the Islamic faith as inherently violent and rebellious and have advocated for the continuation of Christian conversion in the region. While this would be popular with the patriarch and other religious conservative voices, such a move might further destabilise an already-delicate region of Russia."
 ivanomika.36.a:0 "Just...let them be."
 ivanomika.36.b:0 "The word of Christ shall reach the tallest peaks!"

 ivanomika.37.t:0 "The Wealth of Warm Water"
 ivanomika.37.d:0 "Historically, Russia has always had the desire for warm water ports with which to build up and exert its naval influence. As the Black Sea now lays open for us once again, the opportunity to rebuild Russian presence in the Seven Seas is ours to take. The question is, where should these new ports be built?"
 ivanomika.37.a:0 "We shall build a new port city on the coast and christen it "Ivangrad"."
 ivanomika.37.b:0 "We should just build up our existing ports in the region."

 ivanomika.38.t:0 "Oil in the Caspian"
 ivanomika.38.d:0 "The Caspian Sea is rich in natural resources, most of which is oil. The refining of oil is one that Russia relies on heavily for its economy, however private companies have also expressed interest in owning the region's oil reserves themselves. As the Caspian sits there untouched, the final decision is to..."
 ivanomika.38.a:0 "Claim the Caspian for state companies."
 ivanomika.38.b:0 "Let the free market own the Caspian's oil."

 ivanomika.39.t:0 "The Fate of Crimea"
 ivanomika.39.d:0 "With the region of Crimea finally in our control again, its status is once again left up in the air. While the Nazis used it for their own twisted resort, we have the opportunity to rebuild Crimea anew with a variety of options. The Crimean Tatars have expressed interest in controlling the oblast once again as an autonomous republic, the Agricultural Ministry wants to turn it into a new hub for farming and those in the navy want to turn Sevastopol into a new home for the future Baltic Fleet."
 ivanomika.39.a:0 "The Crimeans will have their home back."
 ivanomika.39.b:0 "Crimea will become a land of plows and cattle."
 ivanomika.39.c:0 "Crimea will become a hub of commerce and the Baltic Fleet."

 ivanomika.40.t:0 "The New Capital?"
 ivanomika.40.d:0 "Russia has had many capitals in its history. As we have reclaimed Russia from the German barbarians, it is now time to select a permanent capital from which to govern our new unified nation."
 ivanomika.40.a:0 "Moscow is a good choice."
 ivanomika.40.b:0 "Petrograd is the ideal choice."
 ivanomika.40.c:0 "Novosibirsk is an important hub, and is the best choice."
 ivanomika.40.e:0 "We should just stay in Vladivostok."

 ivanomika.41.t:0 "The Reconstruction of Moscow"
 ivanomika.41.d:0 "Moscow, one of the historical capitals of Russia, had been brutally ripped apart and bastardized by the occupying Germans. As the ruined city is once again in our control, the question of how to rebuild Moscow is one that interests President Mikhailov greatly. As many city planners have presented their proposals for a new Moscow, the one that was finally decided on was..."
 ivanomika.41.a:0 "A new, tourist-friendly Moscow that celebrates its history"
 ivanomika.41.b:0 "A Moscow built like a modern, western city"
 ivanomika.41.c:0 "A new Moscow built with a modernist aesthetic."

 ivanomika.42.t:0 "The Reconstruction of Petrograd"
 ivanomika.42.d:0 "Petrograd, one of the historical capitals of Russia and vital naval/commerce hub had been brutalized by the Nazi invaders. As the city is finally in our hands again, the skylines are but a shell of their former selves. The need to rebuilt the city, therefore, is imperative. As various architects and city planners submitted their proposals for a new Petrograd, the final decision going forward will be..."
 ivanomika.42.a:0 "Petrograd shall be a modern port city."
 ivanomika.42.b:0 "Petrograd shall be rebuilt as a modern, western city."
 ivanomika.42.c:0 "Petrograd shall be rebuilt in a baroque style."

 ivanomika.43.t:0 "Rebuilding Our Nation"
 ivanomika.43.d:0 "The entirety of the Russian nation has been brutalized by over a decade of endless war and brutal occupation. As Russia gradually reunites itself, the question of what sort of nation Russia will become is one that we now have the power to change."
 ivanomika.43.a:0 "Russia shall return to its roots as an agrarian nation."
 ivanomika.43.b:0 "Bringing back the industry of old will make Russia great again."

 ivanomika.44.t:0 "The Fate of the Jews"
 ivanomika.44.d:0 "Russia's history with the Jewish people are....extremely complicated. Despite centuries of oppression, many Jews continue to call Russia their home no matter the ruler. While most of them had been murdered by the Germans, there are still many in the new Russia that need to be addressed.\n\nReligious figures and those in the former Octobrist Party have called for their expulsion on the grounds of their alleged economic exploitation, while many others across the political spectrum either sympathize or are indifferent towards the plight of Russian Jews. Not one to leave such an important question unanswered, Mikhailov's decision on the "Jewish matter was final":"
 ivanomika.44.a:0 "The Jews should stay."
 ivanomika.44.b:0 "The Jews would have to find a new home."

 ivanomika.45.t:0 "A Russian Aliyah"
 ivanomika.45.d:0 "The turbulent lands of Russia have seen over a decade of internal and external strife. This conflict has, unfortunately, caused tremendous suffering for Russia's Jewish population. In a stunning announcement from [RUS.Capital.GetName] earlier this week, Russia's Jews would be forced to leave the country on the grounds of "economic sabotage". A week later, the first refugees from Russia have arrived in Tel Aviv to make Aliyah."
 ivanomika.45.a:0 "You too, are welcome in the Land of Israel." 

 ivanomika.46.t:0 "The Fate of the Partisans"
 ivanomika.46.d:0 "As German boots marched into Russia, many took up arms against them in a valliant struggle for freedom. Many of these partisans, however, sympathized with the ideals of communism. As these former partisans reintegrate into new life in our republic, their future remains uncertain. While it is true that they fought the Germans just as we did, their sympathies with a violent ideology causes problems that many are uncomfortable with addressing."
 ivanomika.46.a:0 "They are patriots, let's treat them as such."

Foreign observers have noted that many attending this conference are from conservative and reactionary camps from across Russia, and that their intentions might very well be to finally bring Russia back to the days of Kolchak.

 ivanomika.55.d:0 "The original constitution set a limit of three maximum terms for a sitting president to run for office. While this may have been considered a good idea by Kerensky and his compatriots, the stark reality of Russia's situation in the 1940s and 50s made good governance in a struggling nation impossible.\n\nRussia needed and continues to need assertive presidents that hold office for long periods of time. Henceforth, the limits on the maximum number of presidental terms have been annulled."

President Mikhailov is expected to officially sign the new constitution into effect the following morning, a true mark of how far the Russian Republic has come from its days as a rump state in Vladivostok.\n\nThe new Russia is a nation that has successfully cast off the chains of fascist colonialism and communist tyranny. The wounds caused by years of war have been healed through the careful methodology known as Ivanomika, however the generational wounds and those of the pre-war cities and towns permanently altered by war may never go away."

An avid anti-communist, Poremsky has been an outspoken supporter of Mikhailov's policies and an advocate for a great Russian crusade against extremism. Last but not least is the Belarusian-American communications tycoon David Sarnoff. A staunch conservative, Sarnoff's investments in Russian telecommunications have made him into a household name.\n\nInviting the three esteemed men into his office, Mikhailov spoke at great length about his desire to enrich them with money and influence so long as they work towards his interests. Not one to pass up on such an opportunity, Mikhailov's new troika enthusiastically agreed, celebrating with a bottle of vodka. Sarnoff will be responsible for bolstering Russia's influence abroad, as Poremsky rallies local industrialists to support Mikhailov's new "Ivanomika" reforms, while Semyonov works to boost Mikhailov's legitimacy as a proper successor to the great White movement."

Chernov was an extremely intelligent ideologue born to an impoverished family of serfs, eventually rising as one of Russia's most prominent socialist politicians. Having thrown his weight behind Alexander Kerensky's provisional republic in 1917, he had campaigned tirelessly fighting the old tsarist-era landlord/serf system that had plagued him and millions of other Russians for centuries. Fleeing to the United States when the Bolsheviks won the Russian Civil War, Chernov was among the first of the "old guard" to arrive in the reformed Russian Republic, enthusiastic about reigniting what he hoped would be a Russia rurality free from corrupt, self-centred landlords. Though Chernov served as Prime Minister, he would ultimately not be able to hold power, as he was replaced by the military following the killing of Kerensky. As news spread of his passing, the senior party officials have called an emergency meeting to discuss the future of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. Many have hypothesized that the new party leadership will become hotly contested to the point of potentially fracturing the already-fragile union of Left and Right Wing SRs."

 russiaflavour.5.d:0 "Tragedy has struck the Left-Socialist Revolutionaries as its long-time leader Isaac Steinberg passed away today at the age of 68. Born to a family of Jewish merchants, the young Steinberg had joined the SRs in 1906, quickly becoming a political dissident under the Tsar's absolutist rule. A staunch anti-war revolutionary, he was initially delighted with the results of the February Revolution and was elected a delegate in Kerensky's Constituent Assembly. Although weary of the Bolsheviks, he nonetheless took up the position of Commissioner of Justice in the RSFSR, becoming well-known for his extremely lenient handling of political prisoners. Butting heads with Vladimir Lenin on more than one occasion regardng Sovnarkom's punitive measures against so-called "enemies of the state", Steinberg began drifting away from the Bolsheviks: eventually leaving Soviet Russia altogether when the Brest-Litovsk Treaty was signed. Isaac moved to Weimar Germany and began working with socialist and Jewish Territorialist groups until Hitler seized power in 1933. Living his life as an emigre in Canada until the Russian Republic's revival, he returned to the new government espousing anarchist and syndicalist rhetoric, something which earned him significant notoriety in the later Kerensky years.\n\nHaving passed his socialist movement onto the relatively-unknown Andrei Sinyavsky, the Left-SR's new leader is known only to some as a popular literary critic.\n\nWhether the Socialist's new young leader can bring the party into the political mainstream however, remains to be seen."

 russiaflavour.7.d:0 "Following the initial success of its first restaurant in Vladivostok, Mikhayly has since been opening new locations across the capital. As smaller towns across the Republic gradually grow amidst years of government neglect, the demand for the same ameneties as the capital have only grown in scale.\n\nLooking to expand into this new market, Mikhayly Burgers and Fries has announced its first out-of-city locations in Khabarovsk, Yakutsk, and other settlements. The move is projected to bring new jobs to the struggling states in Siberia and further export the greatest benefits that western capitalism has to offer."

 russiaflavour.8.d:0 "Following our glorious victory over the Soviet Union, our own legitimacy as the sole state body of Russia has been solidifed. With this new found prestige, our friendship with the Americans now prospers like never before. Not one to pass up on Russia's new and vast opportunities, American fast-food chains have announced their intentions to open franchises starting in Perm, Novosibirsk and Vladivostok.\n\nWhile the move is a welcome one for many, the dominant Russian fast-food chain Mikhayly is rumoured to be nervous about the new competition presented by "ambitious Yanks" in what could quickly become a corporate rivalry unlike any other."
 russiaflavour.8.a:0 "Perhaps a bit of competition wouldn't be too bad..."

 russiaflavour.9.t:0 "The Great Fast-Food Debate"
 russiaflavour.9.d:0 "The first American-owned fast-food chains have opened in Russia's major cities today, and already the prospect of a legendary corporate rivalry seems immenient. Seeking to maintain their monopoly on the industry by any means necessary, Mikhayly Burgers and Fries has launched massive ad campaigns across the radio and newspapers as well as for the first time, television. Smearing American brands as nothing more than heartless suits with no true passion for the hamburger, the ads have for the first time used Russian nationalist rhetoric to promote themselves as the patriotic choice for every true Russian.\n\nIn a stunt considered by some to be shallow corporate sponsorship, President [ROOT.GetLeader] visited a Mikhayly diner in Perm to much media fanfare. As pictures of the most powerful man in Russia chowing down on a hamburger quickly circulated through the Russian press, it would appear that the race to win the hearts and appetites of Russia has only just begun."

 russiaflavour.10.t:0 ""The Citizen-Emperor" Published"
 russiaflavour.10.d:0 "The Republic has for years been considered a safe refuge for both Chinese and Russian dissidents alike, but perhaps one of the most infamous of these dissidents is the former puppet emperor of Manchuria and China Aisin Gioro Puyi. Having fled the Japanese puppet regime in Manchuria following the swift collapse of the Japanese Empire, the fugitive emperor had quietly slipped out of his former ancestral homeland and lived in relative obscurity until the Russian Republic's founding. Reluctantly becoming a naturalized citizen in the Republic, Puyi quickly became known to the press as a local oddity far from home. Despite multiple requests from the Chinese Nationalist government to extradite Puyi to stand for war crimes, Puyi has nonetheless lived his Russian life in relative peace.\n\nOn the encouragement of his closest friends, Puyi has now published an autobiography about his life experiences from the Forbidden City all the way to Vladivostok. Titled "The Citizen-Emperor", the book was quickly translated into Russian and became an instant bestseller among Russia's fascinated audience. Despite outrage from the Chinese government however, copies of the book have also been sold in China. Praised by literary critics as a gifted author, Puyi has in an interesting change of faith found his true calling as a writer."

 russiaflavour.12.d:0 "Even the seemingly-barren lands of Siberia are home to some of Russia's greatest natural treasures.

A focal point in the Russian Civil War and the Great Reunification Wars not long ago, the vast river is now open for limited campground operations, beaches and cultural events featuring Amur's various ethnic groups."

 russiaflavour.14.t:0 "The Blood Rivers of Lena"
 russiaflavour.14.d:0 "The tranquil rivers of the Lena have harboured a dark secret from those who don't know her history. What started as a general strike among gold miners in 1912 turned into a bloody massacre at the hands of strikebreakers and Tsarist troops, killing 270. A significant step towards the alienation of the Tsarist regime and the rise of worker's rights advocacy in Russia, the Duma commission investigating the disaster was headed by none other than Alexander Kerensky, skyrocketing the popularity of the formerly-obscure lawyer from Simbirsk. A solemn site considered a site of brave sacrifice by both Bolsheviks and Social Democrats alike, the calm and beautiful rivers have been designated a protected heritage site."
 russiaflavour.14.a:0 "An injury to one is an injury to all."

 russiaflavour.15.t:0 "The [GetYear] Yekaterinburg Mayoral Election"
 russiaflavour.15.d:0 "Throughout Russia, mayoral elections are, of course, common; an expression of the people's will to determine how even their city is run, a democratic process. Relatively uncommon in the Russian Empire and Soviet Union, in our Republic they have become a frequent event in larger cities, such as Vladivostok, Novosibirsk, Perm, and Krasnoyarsk. However, these mayoral elections rarely receive much national attention, and are typically considered just part of local politics. A recent election in the city of Yekaterinburg, however, has bucked that tradition.\n\nKnown most infamously for being the site of the Ipatiev House, where the Romanov family was executed in 1918, the recent mayoral election in Yekaterinburg has resulted in an unexpected landslide victory for a little-known opposition candidate. The candidate, promising anti-corruption, construction of affordable housing in order to stop homelessness, and rapid development of infrastructure and industry. Promising to turn Yekaterinburg into a "Detroit of the Urals", new mayor Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin has no political experience whatsoever, having previously been a construction worker. In a speech to the press following his victory, Yeltsin said that he had no further political ambitions for the time being, and that fulfilling his electoral promises was his only goal at present."
 russiaflavour.15.a:0 "Perhaps he will be President one day."

 russiaflavour.16.t:0 "Yakut Language Reform"
 russiaflavour.16.d:0 "With the expression of minorities on the upswing, the issue of language has come to light, as it did during the early Soviet period. This time, the matter of linguistic and orthographic reform has sprung up in none other than the coal-mining governorate of Yakutia, where indigenous Yakut leaders have entertained the idea of a new, non-Cyrillic script - particularly, Semen Nogoruodap's plan based on the International Phonetic Alphabet.\n\nYakut intellectuals are not united, however, and some with more pan-Turkic inclinations have suggested an alphabet similar to the proposed Latin-based Yañalif alphabet for the Tatar language. Whatever the script, however, both sides agree: the Yakut people, and non-Russians within Russia as a whole, deserve the right to their own scripts."
 russiaflavour.16.a:0 "Nogoroudap's script fits the intricacies of the language."
 russiaflavour.16.b:0 "Yañalif will connect them to their Turkic brethren."
 russiaflavour.16.c:0 "Who cares? They should be speaking Russian anyways!"

 russiaflavour.17.t:0 "Lolita"
 russiaflavour.17.d:0 "Headlines have been made in Russia, as opposition politician and prolific author Vladimir Nabokov has released his latest, and, in his own view, greatest work; Lolita, a tale about a paedophilic French professor who sexualises and eventually molests a twelve year-old American girl.\n\nThe book has already proven to be extremely controversial both within Russia and abroad; some have praised it as "a classic", while others have criticised it for its pornographic themes, especially involving a minor. An informal ban on publishing it in Britain has already been placed, and many in Russia, most notably Octobrist leader Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, are also lobbying for a ban.\n\nIn a debate in the Duma, Octobrist deputy Lev Gumilyov gave a speech strongly criticising Nabokov, and called on him to resign, though it is unlikely that this effort will make any ground. Nabokov has called the piece his greatest work yet, despite the hailstorm of criticism he has faced, and denies that he himself has any paedophilic desires himself."

Following a brief acting Presidency under Viktor Chernov, general Anatoly Rogozhin took power in a coup, and has ruled ever since. With America and the pro-democratic youth breathing down his neck, however, Rogozhin must quickly choose Russia's destiny: democracy or dictatorship?"
