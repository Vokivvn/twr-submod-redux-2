    ###Ideas###
    UZB_The_Red_Emir:0 "The Red Emir"
    UZB_The_Red_Emir_desc:0 "Shahmurad Olimov is no mere general, he is the son of the last Emir of Bukhara, Alim Khan.  Though he long ago renounced monarchism and the throne, this fact has enabled him to achieve nearly monarchical levels of power anyway.  As the single unifying figure in Uzbekistan, many see his rule as either a benevolent combination of the Emirate and Soviet systems, or as an amalgamation, descended from neither.  His personal influence and power however remain a unifying factor in the state, compared to its neighbors."
    UZB_Surrounded_On_All_Sides_But_One:0 "Surrounded On All Sides, But One"
    UZB_Surrounded_On_All_Sides_But_One_desc:0 "Ever since the collapse of the united Turkestani state, the Commissariat has been surrounded by hostile nations on all sides but one: to the northeast.  Despite the vast drain on resources it takes us to secure these borders against our foes, support from Vlasov makes it possible, as we have the most advanced local military in the region.  The Uzbek National Army may not be able to unite Turkestan yet, but given the number of Enemies nearby, it will have to try."
    
    ###Leader###
    OLIMOV_DESC:0 "Shahmurad Olimov, born sometime around 1910 in Bukhara, is a symbol of both the end and beginning of Uzbek independence in Turkestan.  The son of the last Emir Of Bukhara, Olimov grew up during the Russian civil war, in which his father's throne and nation were subsumed into the USSR.  Shahmurad made the most of this however, and he denounced his father in order to progress through the Soviet system unlike his brothers, whose refusal to do so led to their deaths.  Olimov would serve in the Red Army during the German-Soviet War, even losing a leg in the desperate fight against fascism.  It was not be though, and after the death of Stalin, many Uzbeks began leaving the army and returning home, where an independent Turkestan had been declared. \n\nOlimov was one of those who returned, and his status and heritage afforded him many privileges in the new status quo.  This would have been lovely, had Turkestan then not itself collapsed into more states, one of them for the Uzbeks.  Olimov quickly used his red army connections, in tandem with his heritage to assert control over the Uzbek regions before others, such as the Turkestani Legion could do so.  The "Red Emir" as he came to be called, has since courted the ideas of Andrey Vlasov, his neighbor and ally to the North.  He seeks to apply these ideas of a socialist national aesthetic, with market reform and expansion, so as to rebuild Turkestan."
