 RSB_Karbyshevs_Last_Stand_idea_desc:0 "General Karbyshev is at death's door. A man more than seventy years old, who has survived horrors beyond the comprehension of most men, he is not long for this world. Karbyshev will lead for as long as he can - but ultimately, he will die, and our band of rebels will lose a strong man.\n\nHopefully, he will not be the only one who can lead us."

 POLITICS_DMITRY_KARBYSHEV_DESC:0 "Dmitry Mikhailovich Karbyshev is a man who has been to hell and back. From camp to camp, he has gone; he has suffered beating after beating. He has reached the end of his rope, again and again - and held on. He has not buckled, not given in to the German invaders. Karbyshev lives, and fights on - for there can be no kneeling before the fascist invader. The evil yoke must be overthrown, and it is not just the fate of Russia, but of all peoples of the world, which depends on it.\n\nBorn in 1880 in Omsk to a family of Siberian Cossack soldiers, Karbyshev was quickly exposed to leftism: when he was only 7, his older brother was arrested for supporting Aleksandr Ulyanov's attempt to assassinate Tsar Aleksandr III. His older cousin, also a supporter of the Narodnichestvo, was internally exiled for her revolutionary activities. Nonetheless, Karbyshev served loyally in the Tsar's army, becoming an accomplished veteran of the Russo-Japanese and First World Wars. That is, until the Civil War began; he joined the Red Army.\n\nKarbyshev's service continued, and, by the 1930s, was recognised as one of most skilled military engineers in the world. When the German invasion began, he returned to the front, for his homeland, and was captured. The Germans attempted to persuade him to lead the ROA, but he refused such things - and his interactions with his captors soon turned violent. Karbyshev was beaten, transferred from camp to camp. And yet, despite the blood, and despite his advanced age, he resisted. He fought for freedom, no matter how harsh the beatings became. For it was not his life which depended upon it, but the lives of his countrymen. The Germans wanted to execute him, but Bunyachenko refused such things - he hoped that someday, Karbyshev would turn around and join the ROA that he adamantly refused to lead.\n\nAnd now, as the Hitlerist realm returns to dust, Karbyshev makes his greatest, final stand, not among the ROA, but among his fellow inmates. The German war machine, though strangled from its home, remains strong, and the traitors try to save their skins. But Karbyshev will not give in now - not when liberation from the menace remains in reach. And though his body fades, his spirit remains as strong as ever. For the motherland, General Karbyshev will give it all, and more - there is no other choice."

 RSB_The_Last_Stand:0 "The Last Stand"
 RSB_The_Last_Stand_desc:0 "Rise, brothers and sisters; the hour has come. The hour in which we shall cast aside our shackles, and fight for our freedom. We yearn for liberty and peace - and the German goliath shall not stand in our way for a moment longer. With a David in each of us, we rise, for the hour of the final struggle has come."
 RSB_Rally_the_Inmates:0 "Rally the Inmates"
 RSB_Rally_the_Inmates_desc:0 "We look upon Canaan, and find it to be a land inhabited with giants. But we cannot return to slavery, and suffer out of fear. Those who have no will to take action shall spend their lives wandering, never seeing their motherland again - and their children will grow up never seeing it themselves. Unless we are to make our move, it shall be the fascists who will rule our homes forevermore."
 RSB_A_Gun_for_Every_Soul:0 "A Gun for Every Soul"
 RSB_A_Gun_for_Every_Soul_desc:0 "The fascist pharaoh which slaughters us has no desire to give us any sense of freedom, and thus, we must take matters into our own hands. We must arm each and every soul with a firearm, so as to deter the killers, and kill them if necessary. We have gotten this far; let us not have it all go to waste."
 RSB_Meet_with_Partisan_Leadership:0 "Meet with Partisan Leadership"
 RSB_Meet_with_Partisan_Leadership_desc:0 "We are under the impromptu protection of the Red Army insurgents from Bryansk and Smolensk, who have the same aims of liberation and antifascism in mind as we do. Comrade Dmitry Mikhailovich, himself a high-ranking man of the Red Army prior to his capture, has expressed a willingness to meet with the leadership of the partisans. Let us go to their headquarters, and see what they have to offer us."
 RSB_Execute_the_Officers:0 "Execute the Officers"
 RSB_Execute_the_Officers_desc:0 "We have bound our slave masters in the chains that they once shackled us with, and held them captive. Let us send a message to the Germans that we will not so easily return to the fold, and kill these monsters ourselves. Their barracks, their Sodom, shall be where they die; and those fascists who return shall be put to death themselves."
 RSB_An_Eye_for_an_Eye:0 "An Eye for an Eye"
 RSB_An_Eye_for_an_Eye_desc:0 "The German coloniser has sought to completely destroy our homeland, polluting it with his hateful ideology and destructive tendencies. As we assert control over more land, we find more German colonists in our hands. What to do with them is simply answered: Let us destroy these Midianites, and reclaim what has been pillaged from us."
 RSB_The_Chain_Ends_Here:0 "The Chain Ends Here"
 RSB_The_Chain_Ends_Here_desc:0 "Yes, we want an eye for an eye when it comes to the Germans; we want justice which is reasonable, and no more. If we are to go after the Germans, then the cycle of violence will simply continue forever, until there is nobody left. Let us take what is necessary to rebuild, and nothing more - they can get what they need themselves."
 RSB_Arise_Comrades:0 "Arise, Comrades!"
 RSB_Arise_Comrades_desc:0 "The fascist murderers are bloodthirsty, knowing that their hour of defeat is near. They seek to inflict upon us slavery and torture once more, and will not stop until every one of us is dead. We cannot allow such things to happen, and must fight for the freedom of all peoples who have been conquered. Arise, prisoners! Arise, slaves! Arise, and take the liberty the Germans took from you!"
 RSB_Soup_for_the_Needy:0 "Soup for the Needy"
 RSB_Soup_for_the_Needy_desc:0 "Among us, who is not in need? We have freed ourselves from the harshest pharaohs, and now many who cannot fight await total liberation. Let us assemble our weak so that they may help one another, and support the establishment of soup kitchens. We must work so that none go hungry, and that everyone will be nourished."
 RSB_Bread_and_Bullets:0 "Bread and Bullets"
 RSB_Bread_and_Bullets_desc:0 "We are in need on both the domestic and war front. We must feed all the souls who have gone hungry, and supply bullets to all who fight for their brethren. We must seek to greatly increase production, so that all needs are fulfilled. We have a stream in the desert of famine, and from that stream, we shall plant a forest."
 RSB_Fight_the_Collaborators:0 "Fight the Collaborators"
 RSB_Fight_the_Collaborators_desc:0 "As a dog returns to his vomit, so too shall a fool repeat his errors. The men of the Committee for the "Liberation" of the Peoples of Russia, despite renouncing their collaboration with the Germans, will no doubt return to their crimes before long. It is necessary to fight these fascists where they stand, and eliminate them altogether."
 RSB_The_Issue_of_the_Red_Army:0 "The Issue of the Red Army"
 RSB_The_Issue_of_the_Red_Army_desc:0 "Recently, the Red Army, our benefactors and protectors, have begun to make moves in order to further subjugate us to them. As we become powerful enough to stand on our own, some commanders have claimed that the Red Army partisans have been overtaken by corruption and autocracy, and that it is necessary to put them down."
 RSB_The_World_Cannot_Remain_Silent:0 "The World Cannot Remain Silent!"
 RSB_The_World_Cannot_Remain_Silent_desc:0 "We have seen horrors unmatched in history. A war of apocalyptic proportions has been waged upon innocent souls, as people are slaughtered for no reason other than that they are not Germans. But this reign of terror has come to an end, at last, as the millions who have survived pick up the pieces and reassemble what remains of their homes, their lives, and their families.\n\n"Comrades, remember the motherland, and courage will follow with you!""

 rsb.1.t:0 "A Meeting with Saburov"
 rsb.1.d:0 "Today, general Karbyshev held a private meeting with commander of the Red Army partisans in Muscovy, Aleksandr Nikolayevich Saburov. Our closest allies in this war of liberation, we have requested a deal; rifle shipments, which they agreed to. With these weapons, we shall be able to more efficiently fight the fascists out of our motherland."
 rsb.1.a:0 "We thank our comrades!"
 
 rsb.2.t:0 "The End of the Freed"
 rsb.2.d:0 "We have received reports that, following the death of General Karbyshev, [RSB.GetNameDef] has fallen into chaos. The remaining leadership has decided to surrender to us, integrating themselves into our Red Army."
 rsb.2.a:0 "Good for us."
 
 rsb.3.t:0 "SS Officers Executed"
 rsb.3.d:0 "With our uprising against the fascist murderers, we have found ourselves with plenty of them as prisoners. Until now, they have been held temporarily in the camps where they once held us. But now, orders from central headquarters have commanded the total liquidation of all Schutzstaffel officers, citing concerns of possible insurrection."
 rsb.3.a:0 "The only cure for fascism."
 
 rsb.4.t:0 "Slaves Executing Our Officers!"
 rsb.4.d:0 "We have received news that the revolting slaves in Tver have begun mass executions of our officers! While we have hidden such news, rumours have spread, and we have begun to receive reports of soldiers losing their will to fight..."
 rsb.4.a:0 "Damn them!"
 
 rsb.5.t:0 "Slave Terror Campaign"
 rsb.5.d:0 "We have received reports that our former slaves, headquartered in Tver and led by that old red general, have begun to orchestrate a terror campaign against the German colonists. While we have kept such news on the down-low, rumours of the campaign have spread like wildfire, and many soldiers have begun to wonder what they are fighting for..."
 rsb.5.a:0 "We must do something about them..."
 
 rsb.6.t:0 "The Issue of the Red Army"
 rsb.6.d:0 "Our friendship with the Moscow Red Army is amicable on both sides, but has recently begun to see some level of conflict. Fearing that this may be the result of something more dangerous, several officers within our ranks have suggested that it is a plot to destroy us, and that we should begin a preemptive attack against them. However, others have said that any relationship has its issues, and that we have no reason to go on the offensive. What is the answer?"
 rsb.6.a:0 "Go ahead with it."
 rsb.6.b:0 "They are our allies, what need do we have to fight them?"
 
 rsb.7.t:0 "The Death of Karbyshev"
 rsb.7.d:0 "In the early hours of the morning, comrade Dmitry Mikhailovich died peacefully in his sleep. The death of the dear general, who remained strong in body and mind until his last waking breath, comes as no surprise given his longevity, but has nonetheless sent our comrades into shock, and a period of great mourning has dawned upon the nation.\n\nIn the halls of power, however, things are quickly becoming undone. The greedy and the good have turned upon one another, seeking to oust one another and assert themselves as the sole leaders of our movement. As the struggle unfolds and things fall apart, many refugees and soldiers have begun to flee, leaving to other partisan forces, to Perm, or perhaps even to greener pastures in the west, free of fascism.\n\nWith the death of General Karbyshev and the subsequent implosion of our leadership, we have failed in our war of liberation."
 rsb.7.a:0 "Farewell, dear general."
