### LEADERS ###
###############

VARLAM_SHALAMOV_DESC:0 "Varlam Shalamov was born on June 18th, 1907, to a family of educators and priests. His father, an Orthodox priest, had even spent a decade before the birth of Varlam as a missionary in Alaska with Varlam's older brother. Gaining a love of poetry and education from his mother early in life, Varlam would attend one of the Empire's best schools starting in 1914. However World War One greatly affected Varlam's life, as his brother would die, and a new radical political thought would take over Russia: Bolshevism. Dismissed from school due to his father's role as priest, Varlam worked as a tanner before entering Soviet law school instead, and becoming a student of literature. He particularly would come to enjoy Dostoevsky, Pasternak, Pushkin, and even a well known SR, Boris Savinkov. But primarily he became acquainted with the writings of Leon Trotsky, who he came to see as the legitimate leader of Bolshevism, not Joseph Stalin. However, his connection to Trotskyists would lead to repeated arrests in life and detentions, at the hands of Stalin's ruthless NKVD.\n\nServing a lengthy prison sentence when the war began, Varlam would soon be free again.  When the Union all but collapsed, Shalamov's GULAG was abandoned, and many of the inmates fled east to Buryatia, away from Stalinism. Shalamov was one of these, and he eventually met up with former SR friends, and joined the organization soon after settling down in Ulan-Ude. However this peace would not last, as the Russian Fascist Party began an insurgency across much of the far east, and began terrorizing many of Shalamov's friends and neighbors.  This would lead to the militarization of the SRs in Buryatia, in an attempt to fight the RFP's growing influence, and perceived Republican terror from Vladivostok. Shalamov rapidly became a leader of these militarist SRs, as a man whom the people could untie behind, and know was not a Stalinist sycophant. Now he has risen up, leading his comrades to a brighter future, one illustrated by the wise words of Marx, Lenin, and Trotsky."

### EVENTS ###
##############

sbrnews.1.t:0 "Socialists Reunify Russia"
sbrnews.1.d:0 "In an unexpected turn of events, the agrarian socialists from Buryatia have defeated the Russian Republic and defeated the other rival Russian governments. Beginning as a radical socialist and Trotskyist uprising in the desolate wastelands of Bodaybo, [SBR.GetLeader] brought wide sweeping social and economic reforms to Russia transforming it into a socialist state.\n\nAs the new Russian Federative Socialist Republic looks west, they have made their intentions to retake the lands conquered by the Germans clear; seeking Accord support in the endeavor."
sbrnews.1.a:0 "Was this Kerensky's dream?"

sbrnews.2.t:0 "The Rise Of Trotskyist Russia"
sbrnews.2.d:0 "As the Russian warlord era comes to an end, a new Communist Russia has risen from its ashes as the sole representative of the Russian people. An explicitly Trotskyist nation under the leadership of Chairman Shalamov, the new Union has wasted no time restarting mass-industrialization projects and extensive propaganda campaigns aimed at achieving full unity with western Russia.\n\nThe new Soviet Union has cut all ties with the west, promising that "the tides of permanent revolution will sweep across England and America just as it has in Russia." As the Toronto Accord was quick to respond in kind, the very real possiblity of a possibly hot war with the Soviet Union seems likely in the not-to-distant future."
sbrnews.2.a:0 "The world may even turn red some day."

sbr.1.t:0 "Victory Against The Okrug"
sbr.1.d:0 "Finally, we have defeated the Republic's Okrug cronies in what was the first of many battles to come. We can now begin building our new base before we can strike into the heart of Vladivostok!"
sbr.1.a:0 "First Bodaybo, then all of Russia!"

sbr.2.t:0 "Socialist Saboteurs Rock The Countryside!"
sbr.2.d:0 "Just as the socialists of Buryatia rose up against us, an array of saboteurs have spread across our countrside wreaking havoc both on our supply lines and terrorizing civilians."
sbr.2.a:0 "It will not avail them!"

sbr.3.t:0 "Proclamation Of The Russian Socialist Federative Republic"
sbr.3.d:0 "As we marched into Vladivostok and the false republic collapsed, it is now time to make it known to the world that the far-east has a new master, and the old republic will get a new makeover. Henceforth, the Russian Republic will be reorganized into a socialist federative republic."
sbr.3.a:0 "URA!"

sbr.4.t:0 "Convening of the Russian Socialist Revolutionary Council"
sbr.4.d:0 "With all immediate matters of state dealt with, we can now deal with the future of the united front. With delegates representing all factions of the front meeting in Vladivostok for the first time, the very future of the nation may be at stake."
sbr.4.a:0 "Let's get it done!"

sbr.5.t:0 "The Matter Of Foreign Policy"
sbr.5.d:0 "Eventually, we will one day reunite Russia. When that happens, our dealings with the outside world will have to be addressed. As we barrel into this uncertain future, the two main factions of the SRCO present their opinions:\n\n The agrarian wing suggests we take a stance of limited raproachment with the West for support against the eventual war against Germany. The Trotskyists instead propose the opposite, a hostile stance towards all non-communists of the world in the pursuit of permanent and total revolution. Which way should we go?"
sbr.5.a:0 "The world shall be set free!"
sbr.5.b:0 "The west is a valuable ally."

sbr.6.t:0 "The Matter Of State Security"
sbr.6.d:0 "As we venture deeper into the wastes of Siberia, we will have to deal with internal counter-revolutionary threats from all sides. The Revolutionary Council is, once again, divided on this issue.\n\nThe Trotskyist wing suggests we establish an extensive state security apparatus akin to the Soviet Union in nature, while the agrarians stress a need for some leniency on the matter. In the end though, only one side here can prevail..."
sbr.6.a:0 "You can never be safe around capitalists!"
sbr.6.b:0 "Hold on, let's not get too ahead of ourselves..."

sbr.7.t:0 "The Matter Of The National Anthem"
sbr.7.d:0 "The last of our major agenda points is perhaps the most contentious of all, the national anthem. While most in the government see no issue in sticking with the Worker's Marseillaise, there are those that are kicking up a major fuss about this.\n\nThe Trotskyists see the old anthem as a relic of old reactionary politics, while most in the agrarian wing seem content with staying with what works."
sbr.7.a:0 "Draft a new anthem at once!"
sbr.7.b:0 "Are they nuts? The old one is fine!"

sbr.9.t:0 "Trotskyism Rising"
sbr.9.d:0 "In one of the greatest upsets in Russian political history, the Trotskyists have gained a majority in the Revolutionary Council. Immediately proclaiming their allegiance to now-president Shalamov, it is expected that the new Republic will take on a...redder outlook."
sbr.9.a:0 "And we didn't even need a revolution this time!"

sbr.10.t:0 "The Agrarian Line Holds"
sbr.10.d:0 "Unsurprising to most, Shalamov's agrarian comrades have maintained their control over the Revolutionary Council and expelled the Trotskyists from the government. It would seem that socialist democracy has been saved...for now."
sbr.10.a:0 "Excellent, now back to business."

sbrsavinkov.1.t:0 "The Father Of The SRCO"
sbrsavinkov.1.d:0 "The legacy of the late Boris Savinkov is a complicated one, to say the least. Considered a proto-fascist traitor by some for his allegiances with White generals, and a hero of the Russian people by others, the mark he has left on Russian leftism and Varlam Shalamov is unquestionable.\n\nTo appropriately honour the man, the city of Vladivostok has unvieled a large statue bearing Savinkov's likeness. The people of Vladivostok do not seem all that pleased with the new development, but the fact that even two people recieved it positively is a sign of improvement. Evidence that the Russian psyche is changing for the better, even if very slowly."
sbrsavinkov.1.a:0 "History shall finally vindicate him."

sbr.11.t:0 "The First Soviet Elections"
sbr.11.d:0 "While elections in local Soviets had been ongoing in the old Soviet Union for years, they were largely meaningless ceremonies that gave the communist elites the false belief that they had a governing mandate. As the nation heals from years of war, a new election to the People's Duma will give the Russian people fresh new faces to guide them into the future.\n\nAs the elections are set up though, we will have to be careful. There remains many in the Republic that wish to undermine our democracy by polluting it with backwards philosophies and electoral fraud. To combat this, only parties belonging to the united front will be allowed to participate.\n\nAs the election day finally comes to a close, annd the results are finally tallied, the winner of the [GetYear] elections are..."
sbr.11.a:0 "The United Front with 98.6% of the vote."

sbr.12.t:0 "The Rebirth Of Soviet Communism"
sbr.12.d:0 "With all of our rivals either gone or discredited, everything set up and the people backing us, Varlam Shalamov today annonced that the SRCO was officially defunct. Replacing it would be a rebirth of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, but this time under the immortal principle of Leon Trotsky.\n\nWhile many in the public are outraged by this sudden shift towards their former enemies, the OGPU was quick to suppress the dissenters. As The Internationale plays once more from the radios of Russia, the old Soviet flags are being unfurlled once again to celebrate the occasion.\n\nThe Soviet Union, and the true heir of Lenin, is back."
sbr.12.a:0 "The Party of Lenin shall rise again!"

sbr.13.t:0 "The Legacy Of The "Man of Steel""
sbr.13.d:0 "There is no denying that Stalin's leadership not only destroyed Lenin's dreams, but had doomed the Union to the brink of collapse. he had jailed tens of thousands on false grounds of treason when none existed, causing many proud communists to unfortunately lose their lives.\n\nWe must make the full extent of Stalin's crimes seen by the light of day, every gritty and goery detail. The Russian people must learn of the sacrifices such patriots made in defying Stalin, and the world shall one day see his name with naught but contempt and disgust."
sbr.13.a:0 "We must never forget."

sbr.14.t:0 "The Debate On Religious Matters"
sbr.14.d:0 "As we control one of the most religiously diverse nations on Earth, the question of what to do with the religious institutions of Russia, big and small, is ever-present. We look to the teachings of Marx and note that his own writings preached the end of organized religion, an "opiate of the masses" as he famously called it.\n\nWe live in a different age from Marx, however. The material conditions of Russia in its current state may not be compatible with outspoken anti-clericism like we want. We just may have to instead tolerate these groups for the time being.\n\nAs the poltburo convened to vote on this issue, the eventual decision was..."
sbr.14.a:0 "Follow the teachings of Marx!"
sbr.14.b:0 "Hold off on the religious reform, for now."

sbr.15.t:0 "The New Boss"
sbr.15.d:0 "As Sinyavsky entered the President's office for the first time in his life, he never imagined even him making it this far. Once a mere writer that got in trouble for his opposition to Stalin, he found himself caught up in the SRCO's revolutionary fervor as the Soviet Union crumbled around him. As he settled down into his office desk, he looked through the papers left there for him by Shalamov\n\n"To the future president: The job ahead of you will not be an easy one. The Russian people remain divided and more bitter than ever in ways i can't even begin to describe. But always remember, every decision you make should be not with your heart in mind, but with Russia in mind. For any leader who does not wholly dedicate themselves to their country is no leader at all. Do not let these words pressure you though, I know you will do the best job you can. - Your's truly, Varlam Shalamov."\n\n"P.S. In case you ever need it, my vodka collection is in the drawer behind you.""
sbr.15.a:0 "A touching letter fitting of a toast."

sbr.16.t:0 "[SBR.GetLeader] Offers Us Unification"
sbr.16.d:0 "Considering our common goals towards Trotskyist revolution, [SBR.GetLeader] has sent us an interesting proposal for an alliance. Should we accept?"
sbr.16.a:0 "They are our comrades-in-arms!"
sbr.16.b:0 "Shalamov is but a grifter, the answer is no!"

sbrreunification.1.t:0 "Mass Defections!"
sbrreunification.1.d:0 "Disturbing news as a major portion of our armies has chosen to defect to the enemy. They have taken a significant number of weapons and men with them, but hopefully this won't affect us too much in the long run."
sbrreunification.1.a:0 "They'll regret this!"
