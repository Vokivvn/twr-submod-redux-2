    ##Leader##
    BAYMIRZA_DESC:0 "Baymirza Hayit was born on December 17, 1917, in Yargorgan as one of nine children from his family of Uzbek descent. During his adolescent life, Baymirza developed a desire to learn about literature and art which later helped him compose his works. Despite all the problems he had during the 1930s with his schooling, he only managed to graduate in 1939 to be drafted into the Red Army the same year. He fought with the Red Army, but before the German breakthrough, he had to withdraw to save his life and withdrew in the direction of Turkestan, where he continued to engage in politics, noticing anti-Soviet tensions that were becoming stronger and stronger. With the fall of Turkestan, Baymirza seized his opportunity and took an important place in the Tajik political spectrum. Known for his drive for kleptocracy and his not-so-steely will to solve problems that the rest of the Tajik government had. It is now up to him to lead Tajikistan and prevent it from becoming the new Turkestan - a barrel of gunpowder from which there is no return."
    Toychi_Nazarov_DESC:0 "Born on May 15, 1896, Tuychi Nazarov had a fairly mysterious early life, with one of the few details disclosed being his occupation before the war, a tractor driver for a collective farm. He joined the army in a fairly late stage of the German-Soviet War, being drafted into serving in the 17th Guards Mechanized Brigade. Despite his relatively short duration of service, Nazarov demonstrated impressive skills as a machine gunner. Later on, as the war grew more desperate, Nazarov was promoted to command his very own platoon within his brigade. He was awarded Hero of the Soviet Union for his valiant effort in the Battle of Gorky.\n\nAfter Kalinin assumed power, Nazarov returned to his home in Tajikistan, witnessing both the formation of a united Turkestan and its quick collapse. Alongside a few other veterans, he went on to co-found the Tajikistan Above All Party, a party that quickly gained relevance in Tajikistan. With the help of a "friendly invasion" from the restored Turkestani government, Nazarov went on to replace the preexisting Tajik Soviet rump."

    TAJ_The_Checkpoint_to_Illegality:0 "The Checkpoint to Illegality"
    TAJ_The_Checkpoint_to_Illegality_desc:0 "After the war with the Turkestanis resulted in the subjugation of the Tajikistani state, Tajikistan has been acting as the checkpoint between Turkestan and Afghanistan, with most criminals and smugglers passing through the area to get to their main hub of trade. While gaining more from direct "tariffs" and "tolls" placed by the kleptocratic government, the nation is ripe is crime even worse than Turkestan, both lacking and not caring for securing the people and the nation from crime."
    TAJ_The_One_Month_War:0 "The One Month War"
    TAJ_The_One_Month_War_desc:0 "Following a brief war with the Turkestani government, our forces were defeated and our nation was occupied.\n\nSince then we have become a puppet of our northern neighbors, severely limiting our state’s ability to function."
    TAJ_Red_and_Black_Phantoms:0 "Red and Black Phantoms"
    TAJ_Red_and_Black_Phantoms_desc:0 "Following a brief war with the Turkestani government, our forces were defeated and our nation was occupied. After that event, Soviet remnants in the region, with reluctant socialist support, fled underground. Since then, they have been a constant thorn in the side of our government, constantly harassing our troops and employees.\n\n§RShould this situation not be resolved, they will surely result in the return of Communist control of the region.§!"
