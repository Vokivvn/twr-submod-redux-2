The Winter War had been the blow that healed the wounds of the civil war and united the nation, and spurred on by the drums of revenge and nationalism, alongside the German brothers, lady Finland had once again sent her sons marching into the untouched forests of Karelia.\nTen years later, from the outside, the Finnish nation stands taller and stronger than ever. Shadows are however cast upon Finland by the delayment and problems with Slavic resettlement from Karelia, the instability in Germany, and the fact that Fennia is now among the only democracies left on the European continent."
