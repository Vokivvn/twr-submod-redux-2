 RMO_slave_factories:0 "Toiling of the Enslaved"
 RMO_slave_factories_desc:0 "While Reichskommissariat Moskowien isn't a specialist colony with specific resources to serve Germany, Moskowien functions as the Eastern European Factory of the Reich, having hundreds of slave workshops operating around the clock throughout the region. These workshops produce a great amount of material for conglomeration and state entities, such as mining material and providing cheap labour. "
 RMO_heavy_partisan_activity:0 "Heavy Partisan Activity"
 RMO_heavy_partisan_activity_desc:0 "On the very edge of the German world, Moskowien is under constant threat from the hostile locals. Moskowien's garrison is stretched to its limits, since in every part of the Reichskommissariat, partisans resist the German authority, challenging the German administration in every opportunity."
 RMO_uneasy_collaboration:0 "Uneasy Collaboration"
 RMO_uneasy_collaboration_desc:0 "To aid the German administration in controlling this vast territory, a number of collaborative organizations were established. While administrative organizations were also formed, military organizations became the most influential and dominant, such as the Russian Liberation Army (ROA) and the Russian National Liberation Army (RONA).\n\nWhile these groups are supposedly loyal to Germania, their members are often viewed as unruly and unreliable. To add fuel to the fire, these Russian collaborators are often at odds with one another, creating an additional layer of chaos on top of the already fragile system."
 RMO_nordic_colonials:0 "Nordic Colonization Program"
 RMO_nordic_colonials_desc:0 "An initiative encouraged by the higher echelons of the Nazi Party, the "Nordic Colonization Program" is aimed to encourage settlers from Nordic countries to settle in remote parts of Moskowien with financial incentive. Since the inception of this program, the Quisling regime in Norway has been sending non-threatening political dissidents to participate in this program, even establishing a ministry to control of the program with the approval of the Moskowien government.\n\nBesides Norwegian participation, Finnish and Swedish volunteers have also settled in Moskowien, in the hopes of gaining wealth or the desire for a new life and adventure."

 RMO_unloyal_servants_desc:0 "While the Moskowien's stance on native slavs have been a harsh one, the Reichskommissariat had no choice but to collaborate with certain groups of natives. These Slavic collaborators are used as factory inspectors, auxiliary law enforcers, and even a form of political entity. However, these groups' loyalty are questionable, and it's possible that most of them are plotting Moskowien's demise."

 POLITICS_SIEGFRIED_KASCHE_DESC:0 "A General Officer of the Sturmabteilung, Siegfried Kasche avoided most SA Officers' fate, barely dodging death by pleaing to Hermann Göring. Later on, Kasche secured the position of Moskowien Reichskommissar with his pandering and politicking towards the German High Command.\n\nKasche has been using the Sturmabteilung as his means of oppression within Moskowien, favouring them over the typical security departments.\n\nKasche is ruthless in reaching production quotas, having zero sympathy towards any non-German living in his 'fiefdom' known as Reichskommissariat Moskowien."
 POLITICS_ERICH_VON_DEM_BACH_ZELEWSKI_DESC:0 "The pale horse which gallops through the forests and villages of Moskowien has a rider, and his name is Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski. Given control over a fourth of Germany's Eastern Europe, he has been given the power to kill, be it by bullet, by famine, or by disease. But this power is not something which is foreign to him.\n\nBorn in Pomerania in 1899, von dem Bach-Zelewski lived a poor life, despite being able to lay claim to aristocratic heritage, and fought in the First World War. Shortly afterwards, his fight turned to be against Polish guerrillas in Silesia, before he joined the NSDAP in 1930, the Schutzstaffel in 1931, and the Reichstag in 1932. In 1937, he became head of the SS in Silesia, and following the invasion of Poland, he proposed the construction of camps in the area, in order to house untermenschen.\n\nWhen Operation Barbarossa began, he was placed in charge of the Schutzstaffel bureaucracy in Byelorussia. He oversaw the extermination of Jews from Minsk, Riga, and other cities. Here, fighting the Byelorussian partisans, von dem Bach-Zelewski also developed the concept of responding to rebellion with terror and mass reprisals against civilians; scaring the population into compliance.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the German-Soviet War, he was reassigned to Moskowien as head of the Schutzstaffel, with the hopes that he would quell the troubled Reichskommissariat. And now, with Kasche's suicide, von dem Bach-Zelewski became Reichskommissar himself. Promising to crack down on the resistance, he has brought forth a tidal wave of resistance. Will bandenbekämpfung work out? Or will von dem Bach-Zelewski be the last German to rule Moskowien?"

 twrmoskowien.0.t:0 "What Is Going On Over There?"
 twrmoskowien.0.d:0 "News is just coming in - The Fatherland is in chaos! There are battles being fought all across the Reich, as various factions and leaders attempt to gain the upper hand.  We must immediately decide how we are going to handle this situation.  The administration must decide who, if anyone they are going to support."
 twrmoskowien.0.a:0 "Dear God, We may be doomed..."
 
 twrmoskowien.1.t:0 "The Pillars of Moskowien"
 twrmoskowien.1.d:0 "Ever since the establishment of the Reichskommissariat Moskowien, partisan and terrorist movements of all stripes sprouted through the land, making governance of the colony a titanic task. The German garrisons, both Wehrmacht and Schutzstaffel, were not enough to cope with the demand for pacification brigades and anti-partisan operations in the region.\n\nThere came the KONR, short for Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia, Russian men willing to work with the colonial administration; these armies of natives made it easier to fight terrorist groups while relieving a substantial weight off of the German army's back.\n\nInside of the KONR reside 3 main groups: the Russian Liberation Army, led by Sergei Bunyachenko; the Russian National People's Army, ledy by Sergey Ivanov, and finally the Russian National Liberation Army, led by Bronislav Kaminski. We have to admit it, without the KONR, ruling Moskowien would be excruciatingly difficult, if even possible."
 twrmoskowien.1.a:0 "Interesting."
 
 twrmoskowien.2.t:0 "The Loyal and the Disloyal"
 twrmoskowien.2.d:0 "Inside of the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia reside several varied groups, each one has a different grade of loyalty to the Reichskommissariat:\n\nThe ROA, led by Bunyachenko, is composed of former soviet POWs who wished for better life conditions at the expense of tacitly collaborating with us, they have a strong rivalry with the RONA.\n\nThe RNNA, led by Ivanov, was born way before the war, back in 1921, Ivanov himself is a white emigré, who joined the NSDAP, in 1942, the RNNA became an official fighting force inside of the many Russian collaborator armies.\n\nLast, but not least, there is the RONA, spearheaded by Bronislav Kaminski, formerly a mere military police unit, the RONA received generous support from Himmler and the SS, eventually growing into a giant inside of the KONR."
 twrmoskowien.2.a:0 "We'll have to do something about them."
 
 twrmoskowien.3.t:0 "An (Un)functioning Administration"
 twrmoskowien.3.d:0 "The government of the Reichskommissariat Moskowien is... inefficient, to say the least. Our colony suffers from constant terrorist attacks in the cities and towns; these constant ploys make life in cities and for the German settlers in general very difficult, and there is a high risk of getting killed.\n\nIn the countryside, the partisans rule with almost no opposition. Neither the SS, Wehrmacht, nor even the KONR armies can stem the tide.\n\nOtherwise, providing services like electricity and running water is extremely difficult, we haven't fully rebuilt the little infrastructure the Soviets didn't blow up while retreating, entire cities just get a few hours of electricity."
 twrmoskowien.3.a:0 "What to do, what to do..."
 
 twrmoskowien.4.t:0 "The Power of the SS"
 twrmoskowien.4.d:0 "The SS is a powerful combat force, both in Germany proper and in the colonies, they have helped us and the other Reichskommissariats countless times in the fight against terrorist partisan groups inside of our lands. The Schutzstaffel troops should be what we need at this moment, with partisans getting stronger by the day and seizing more territory than ever before. We will request more SS troops from Germania, stating the necessity of pacifying the native populace and combatting terrorist organizations."
 twrmoskowien.4.a:0 "We don't ask for the Slavs' respect, only their fear."
 
 twrmoskowien.5.t:0 "Bombing at RNNA Headquarters!"
 twrmoskowien.5.d:0 "We are receiving reports of a bombing at the RNNA Headquarters. The bombing, which occurred during a lunch break, injured 3, none seriously. However, we must investigate the issue. Some have suggested that we begin an immediate public investigation, while others suggest that doing so for such a minor incident would only further embolden whoever did this crime. What should we do?"
 twrmoskowien.5.a:0 "Launch an immediate investigation!"
 twrmoskowien.5.b:0 "Let's keep things hush-hush."
 
 twrmoskowien.6.t:0 "Assassination Attempt on Bunyachenko!"
 twrmoskowien.6.d:0 "News has gotten loose of an attempted assassination on ROA leader Sergei Bunyachenko! Bunyachenko was reported to be in good condition, and the perpetrator has been detained. We could launch an investigation into who was responsible, or we could announce the perpetrator quickly to soothe public sentiment; that is, the partisans. What should we do?"
 twrmoskowien.6.a:0 "Launch an investigation into the perpetrator."
 twrmoskowien.6.b:0 "This is the fault of the partisans!"
 
 twrmoskowien.7.t:0 "Partisan Attack Near Smolensk!"
 twrmoskowien.7.d:0 "We have received urgent reports of a partisan attack near the city of Smolensk, resulting in the deaths of several German settlers! Bach-Zelewski insists that retaliation is necessary, but more moderate voices have claimed that such things would only further embolden them among the populace. What should we do?"
 twrmoskowien.7.a:0 "Don't give them any attention."
 twrmoskowien.7.b:0 "Put Bach-Zelewski in charge of pacification."
 
 twrmoskowien.8.t:0 "A Letter to Himmler?"
 twrmoskowien.8.d:0 "To: Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Luitpold Himmler\n\nFrom the administration in the Reichskommissariat Moskowien, we are requesting a major number of Schuttzstaffel units from the Reich. Counter-terrorist operations are to be carried out against partisan groups all-throughought the colony.\nUnits will be dispatched immediately upon arrival and will stay in the Reichskommissariat for an estimated 4 months, carrying out anti-partisan operations, afterwards they are to be sent back to the Reich.\n\nHeil Hitler!\n\n-Siegfried Kasche, Reichskommissar of Moskowien"
 twrmoskowien.8.a:0 "Send it."
 twrmoskowien.8.b:0 "It's not necessary right now."
 
 twrmoskowien.9.t:0 "Worlds Collide"
 twrmoskowien.9.d:0 "Pacification tasks are proving worthless so far, not even our greatest efforts seem to not be enough, the SS, army, and collaborator units are all deployed and fighting, but the partisans always seem to best them in combat.\n\nDifferent parts of the KONR have different answers to this:\n\nIvanov, of the RNNA, proposes to give the KONR in general a greater role in pacification tasks, granting them more concessions and autonomy in exchange for greater help in anti-partisan missions.\n\nOn the other hand, Kaminski, commander of the RONA, proposes to give his army a greater role in pacification, excluding the other parts of the KONR, having his armies being the sole leader of collaborationist anti-terrorist forces.\n\nAll the while, men like Bach-Zelewski are pleading to increase pacification efforts, no matter how."
 twrmoskowien.9.a:0 "Ivanov makes several good points."
 twrmoskowien.9.b:0 "Kaminski is in the right, here."
 twrmoskowien.9.c:0 "Bach-Zelewski has the right idea."
 
 twrmoskowien.10.t:0 "Kaminski Requests Increased Role in Pacification"
 twrmoskowien.10.d:0 "It has come to our attention that Kaminski has been requesting an increased role in our pacification efforts, claiming that his knowledge would enable us to more adequately pacify the population. Others, however, have suggested that this may merely be a vehicle by which to increase his popularity among the people. How should we reply to Kaminski's request?"
 twrmoskowien.10.a:0 "We could always use more hands."
 twrmoskowien.10.b:0 "What? Of course not!"
 
 twrmoskowien.11.t:0 "A Meeting of the Ministers"
 twrmoskowien.11.d:0 "The ministers and high government officials of the colonial administration have all arranged an emergency meeting to supervise the actual state of colonization efforts in the Reichskommissariat. A pile of reports were shared among the ministers, all of them rather worrying; in terms of settling, less than 10 thousand Germans were currently in the colony, an extremely disappointing number.\n\nOtherwise, infrastructure is quite poor in the colony, and entire neighborhoods in big cities were abandoned after the war because of the sheer destruction. Electricity and running water are luxuries in most regions, only working sparsely and for a few hours everyday.\n\nThe meeting concluded eventually, but a question was left: what is to be done with the natives?"
 twrmoskowien.11.a:0 "A more moderate choice is ideal."
 twrmoskowien.11.b:0 "We must take a hard line."
 
 twrmoskowien.12.t:0 "The Restoration of Russian Independence"
 twrmoskowien.12.d:0 "Under the leadership of Bronislav Kaminski, the independence of the Russian nation has been reestablished. A Russia free from bolsheviks, warlords and other kinds of undesirables was born today; reforged from the scraps left by the German colony of Reichkommissariat Moskwien."
 twrmoskowien.12.a:0 "Long live free Russia!"
 
 twrmoskowien.13.t:0 "Black Propaganda!"
 twrmoskowien.13.d:0 "Those German fascist bastards are spreading lies about us to the people! Recently, we've found out the Germans are fabricating misleading propaganda and attributing it to our army. They are falsely distributing outlets and posters where our soldiers are pictured brutally murdering innocent children and women!\n\nWe are making an effort to address these lies, but it seems like it will be a hard task to change the opinion of the people."
 twrmoskowien.13.a:0 "Those damn Germans!"
 
 twrmoscowuprisings.1.t:0 "Chaos in Moskowien"
 twrmoscowuprisings.1.d:0 "With the death of the Führer, we have fallen into chaos! We have received numerous reports of slave uprisings across the Reichskommissariat, and, even worse, that Reichskommissar Kasche has committed suicide! The Reichskommissar reportedly feared that he would be executed, either by a more moderate government in Germania or by a hostile takeover of Moskowien. We are sailing on a ship with no helmsman.\n\nFor the time being, the Reichskommissariat has come under a mixed Schutzstaffel-Wehrmacht administration with no clear leader, but we need to find a new Reichskommissar, and quickly, for if not, we could be facing far worse issues in the not-so-distant future..."
 twrmoscowuprisings.1.a:0 "Don't panic, don't panic!"
 
 twrmoscowuprisings.2.t:0 "Selection of a New Reichskommissar"
 twrmoscowuprisings.2.d:0 "Moskowien's being placed under a temporary administration has temporarily caused a slight ebb in the revolts, but it is clear that we must pick a new Reichskommissar very soon, or face a total collapse of our government - something we would prefer to do without when the Judeo-Bolsheviks are just over the border. Thankfully, two candidates have already presented themselves as ideal for running our government.\n\nThe first, Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, commands the local Schutzstaffel, and pioneered the tactic of Bandenbekämpfung - responding to rebellion with terror, in an effort to scare the populace into submission. The second, Bronislav Kaminski, would be an idiosyncratic choice, to say the least; a Russian collaborator who governs Bryansk, he has nonetheless shown himself to be relatively competent, and urges for more reconciliatory positions in regards to the native population. Who shall be the next to lead this troubled land?"
 twrmoscowuprisings.2.a:0 "Von dem Bach-Zelewski will quell the unrest!"
 twrmoscowuprisings.2.b:0 "Neither candidate is acceptable."
 twrmoscowuprisings.2.c:0 "Kaminski will quiet the Slavs."
 
 twrmoscowuprisings.3.t:0 "Radio Silence"
 twrmoscowuprisings.3.d:0 "Since the selection of the new Reichskommissar, the land has been quiet. Too quiet, in fact. We have sent numerous requests to the ROA and RNNA asking for them to assure their support for the new government, but have received no response. Even a sweep of their "government" offices by the RSHA has revealed a whole lot of nothing; they have been completely emptied and abandoned.\n\nThe slaves, as well, have seemed to suddenly quiet down. We presumed at first that they realised their attempts at rebellion would get nowhere, but now we are beginning to suspect something is happening on that front, as well; countless slaves have begun to suddenly disappear without a trace, oftentimes with their whole families, or other close acquaintances.\n\nWe don't know what is happening, but we know for sure that this quiet is no coincidence; something big is coming. Like the calm before a storm or the ebbing tide before a tsunami, this period of radio silence will not last long. But what is coming? That we do not yet know. But we are almost certain of the involvement of the slaves, the ROA, and the RNNA in this coming storm.\n\nSome local officers have even begun to speak of whispering amidst the trees outside Smolensk..."
 twrmoscowuprisings.3.a:0 "This does not bode well..."
 
 twrmoscowuprisings.400.t:0 "The Anti-German Revolt"
 twrmoscowuprisings.400.d:0 "Since Kasche's suicide, the Reichskommissariat has fallen into chaos. A new Reichskommissar has been selected, yes, but the people of Moskowien seem to have grown restless, and the death of the hated Kasche has broken the proverbial dam. Bunyachenko and Ivanov have both gone silent, despite our repeated frantic letters.\n\nAnd now, with the force of a landmine, the Reichskommissariat has exploded.\n\nWe are receiving reports that throngs of Red Army partisans have begun to emerge from the shadows, taking several cities, such as Smolensk, in the process and announcing the coming liberation of the Russian people from the German "devils". To make matters even worse, it seems that the ROA and RNNA have defected, agreeing to a temporary alliance to bring down us and unite Russia under their own aims. Furthermore, it seems that a band of slaves has risen up around the Tver area, fighting a long-shot struggle for freedom.\n\nThe Reichskommissariat is in a state of great crisis, and our next moves could be our last. Where do we go from here?"
 twrmoscowuprisings.400.a:0 "We will defeat these barbarians, as we have before!"
 twrmoscowuprisings.400.b:0 "Rodine - slava!"
 twrmoscowuprisings.400.c:0 "Long live free Russia!"
 twrmoscowuprisings.400.e:0 "We shall throw off our chains, now and forever!"

 RMO_faction_ROA_tt:0 "§YRussian Liberation Army§!\n--------------\n§gIt began as a propaganda piece during the height of the German-Soviet War. Initially, the Russian Liberation Army (ROA) was never meant to be an actual military organization.\n\nHowever, by 1945, when the Germans have made significant progress against the Soviets, Germania found herself holding tens of thousands of Soviet prisoners of war who are eager to join for the promise of better living conditions or some other ideological beliefs. Among these prisoners, a few were high ranking officers that have gained a newfound distaste for the Bolshevik regime. And after the formation of Reichskommissariat Moskowien, Germania had to come up with plans to levitate the manpower shortage and establish better control. Therefore, it was finally decided that the long fantastical idea of the Russian Liberation Army would come to fruition. High ranking officers were appointed to important positions within the ROA. Most notably, Major General Sergei Bunyachenko was appointed Supreme Commander of the Russian Liberation Army. Alongside this, an air force was also formed under the ROA banner. Since then, the ROA has gained hundreds of thousands of new members across Moskowien, rivaled only by the German garrisons.\n\nIn 1946, the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia (KONR) was created, in an attempt to unify the RONA and the ROA into a central, mostly civilian command. This attempt ultimately failed and has led to the rivalry between the two ever since.§!\n--------------\n§WSupreme Commander:§! §HSergei Bunyachenko§!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n£portrait_Sergei_Bunyachenko\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n§g--------------§!"
 RMO_faction_RONA_tt:0 "§YRussian National Liberation Army§!\n--------------\n§gThe Russian National Liberation Army (RONA) was first founded as an auxiliary police unit in 1941. Initially, the force was nothing but a mere militia unit assisting the Germans in policing the Lokot region. During this time of existence, a twisted form of relationship, with the Germans allowing its continued operations as the de-facto military of the "Lokot Autonomy", even allowing its expansion and allow Bronislav Kaminski to name his growing militia force - the Russian National Liberation Army.\n\nAs RONA kept on expanding, Heinrich Himmler saw great potential in Kaminski's unit. The Schutzstaffel decided to sponsor the RONA, even going as far to assign it a Waffen-SS designation in 1944, weeks before the ROA's formation. Now with a certain degree of backing from the Schutzstaffel, RONA continued expanding and operated with nominal Schutzstaffel support. In 1948, Moskowien Reichskommissar Siegfried Kasche permitted the reformation of the Lokot Autonomy into the Bryansk Republic, granting Kaminski a pseudo-independent state in the hopes of improving the drastic manpower shortage.\n\nIn 1946, the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia (KONR) was created, in an attempt to unify the RONA and the ROA into a central, mostly civilian command.

For a time, the idea remained stagnant. But, in 1942, as the German army groups advanced into the Soviet Union, the leader of this ring of White emigrants, finally proposed to the German command regarding the formation of the RNNA, an offer that was subsequently granted.\n\nWith its leadership consisted of former Tsarist officers and White emigrants, the RNNA was never as popular and effective as other collaborationist formations. Just months after its formation, German high command considered the outright termination of the group, but RNNA managed to survive by performing two successful missions against Red Army formations in Vyazma. Since then, Germany allowed the RNNA to continue its operations and left the White leadership intact.\n\nAfter the formation of Reichskommissariat Moskowien, the RNNA finally found some success, being recognized as part of the Russian Liberation Army. Since then, the RNNA has been operating on a fascistic Tsarist platform, under the supervision of the ROA.§!\n--------------\n§WChief of Staff:§! §HSergey Ivanov§!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n£portrait_Sergey_Ivanov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n§g--------------§!"

However, the difference between Moskowien Schutzstaffel and the main branch operating back in Germany can not be understated.\n\nEstablished alongside the Reichskommissariat, the Moskowien Schutzstaffel bears the same goals and functions as the traditional SS. But, the Moskowien SS has somewhat devolved, comparable only to the Banat SS, albeit with a much larger scale of existing manpower and internal conflicts. The supreme leadership position of the Moskowien Schutzstaffel has been vacant since its inception, due to constant infighting and the fear of further division within the organization. Therefore, in reality, the Moskowien Schutzstaffel has been divided into two camps, one led by general Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, and the other led by secretary Alfred Meyer. Despite the fact that Alfred Meyer is not a member of the Schutzstaffel and is technically a member of the Sturmabteilung, operating in Moskowien as a leader within the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories.\n\nFurthermore, the two factions have overlapping members but often conflicting interests, leading to confusing power struggles and mismanagement. Regardless, it is widely believed that Reichskommissar Siegfried Kasche manufactured this arrangement, hoping to keep the Schutzstaffel busy among themselves instead of threatening his authority.§!"

 ## Legacy Leader Descriptions ##
 ################################
 Korzh_DESC:0 "Commander of the Soviet Partisans in Moscow, Korzh has managed to evade numerous attempts on his life done by the Sturmabteilung. His zone of operation remained in the area of Northern Moskowien, where he managed to gain a large amount of followers and equipment with the help of the Soviet Union. Korzh's hit-and-run tactics were proven to be hugely effective, managing to raise an underground army of liberated slave labourers.\n\nKorzh's only aim is to reunify Moscow with the Soviets, no matter the cost of human lives and resources."
 Skorodumov_DESC:0 "Mikhail Fedorovich Skorodumov has a history of fighting. He has fought Germany and communism, and, in the days when it seemed like both were locked in an unending struggle, he chose Germany.\n\nBorn in 1892, Skorodumov first saw service after graduating from the First Cadet Corps and Pavlovsk Military Academy. He became a lieutenant in the Pavlovsky Regiment, fighting in the First World War. In battle, he was wounded in a charge against the Germans, losing his left leg. But his efforts were successful in bringing a German defeat, and he earned the Order of Saint Vladimir. Skorodumov was declared unfit for service, as expected of any man missing a leg, but he refused to give up, and was sent back to the front, and promptly captured. He tried to escape capture thrice, all unsuccessfully, but was eventually released in a prisoner swap, being awarded the Order of Saint George.\n\nWith the fall of the Tsarist government, Skorodumov began to join underground, anti-communist organisations. When the Civil War broke out, he joined the Volunteer Army, being wounded in the Kiev Offensive before eventually fleeing to Yugoslavia alongside Pyotr Wrangel. Here, he mingled with Anatoly Rogozhin, who would eventually become President of the Russian Republic in the Far East, but Skorodumov chose a different path. He was among the leaders of the Russian Corps, a collaborative organisation in Yugoslavia as the Germans began their invasion. Skorodumov got the Russian Corps transferred to the Eastern Front, so that they could fight for a free Russia - only to be arrested.\n\nOnce again, however, Skorodumov has proven himself a disloyal plotter. As the occupied East descended into chaos, he rose up, declaring a new government. Surrounded by old Tsarists and émigrés, he fights once again. But what are the people of Russia fighting for? Is it their past, and its representative in a legless general, or their future?"
 Grigorenko_DESC:0 "Petro Grigorenko stayed within the Moskowien Region after the Soviet retreat. In the first years of his resistance career, he and his group of partisans fought under the NKVD's command. However, after the rumours of gross misconducts performed by Lavrentiy Beria surfaced, Grigorenko's group of partisans renounced their ties and defied the NKVD. Instead, Grigorenko reorganized his group with the goal of establishing Democratic Socialism."
 Diky_DESC:0 "Andrey Dikiy emigrated to Yugoslavia after the Russian Civil War. Dikiy joined the National Alliance of Russian Solidarists, which he became a leading figure within the organisation. After the rule of Nazi Europe consolidated, Dikiy cooperated and praised the Nazis administration. However, the incompetence of Reichskommissariat Moskowien drove his organisation into a more nationalistic stance. While Dikiy retained most of his Nazi views, his attitude on the Germans has changed from cooperation to Russian independence."
