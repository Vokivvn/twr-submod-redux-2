GER_Military_Reforms_desc:0 "The Heer is a force that can only be saved through reform, both organisationally and training-wise. Anything other than complete reform will result in subpar performance and lacking improvement, which is unacceptable. Let us revive the grandest Army in the world from the ground up, and like a great phoenix, it shall rise more powerful than ever before."
GER_Formalize_Doctrines:0 "Formalize the Doctrines"
GER_Formalize_Doctrines_desc:0 "Despite the revolutionary concepts of Guderian and Lutz regarding Panzer divisions that have granted us outstanding success in the East and West, they have never been recognised or arranged into a proper military doctrine or concept. If the Heer is to act effectively, we shall either embrace manoeuvre warfare fully as a complete doctrinal force or renounce it entirely. We must choose a path to follow; that is the only way the Heer can continue to strive for greatness."
GER_Revitalize_Army:0 "Revitalize the Army"
GER_Revitalize_Army_desc:0 "The Heer has grown stagnant in the past decade, lacking proper equipment and squandering away the scant materiel that we do have. We must increase our efforts to not only produce more, but to ensure that no armament will be lost or misused due to bureaucracy or incompetency in the Heer's ranks."
GER_Train_NCOs:0 "Train New NCOs"
GER_Train_NCOs_desc:0 "Non-commissioned officers are the base of every army, tasked with executing operations and instructing the soldiers under them in how to best reach the strategic goals that they must achieve. Despite their pivotal role in the smooth functioning of the Wehrmacht, the Heer suffers from a critical lack of well trained and well-educated NCOs to lead our men. Universities shall be expanded, schools must be built, and with effort and ingenuity, we shall succeed."
GER_Central_Research_Department:0 "Central Research Department"
GER_Central_Research_Department_desc:0 "Research and development in the Reich's past has often been plagued with bureaucracy and lack of coordination between branches, heavily hampering our efforts to develop revolutionary new weapons and concepts.

GER_Total_Warfare:0 "Total Warfare"
GER_Total_Warfare_desc:0 "The Heer suffers not from an organisational or doctrinal issue. Instead, the problem is simple: not involving every citizen, from the lowliest housewife to the OKW leadership, in the Wehrmacht. We must make the Heer into an organisation encompassing the entire German nation; we must begin total war."
GER_Expand_Draft:0 "Expand the Draft"
GER_Expand_Draft_desc:0 "As of now, the strata of drafted population is a fairly small section, especially compared to when the war with the Soviets was still raging a decade ago. To strengthen our army back into shape, we shall expand the draft, drawing upon a massive reserve of older able-bodied men to fight for Germany in the Heer."
GER_Peoples_Storm:0 "People's Storm"
GER_Peoples_Storm_desc:0 "The Heer has, in its years of decline, suffered from a constant lack of enthusiasm and courage among the men.

GER_Purge_High_Command:0 "Purge the High Command"
GER_Purge_High_Command_desc:0 "The High Command of the Heer has long been suspected to harbour anti-Party sentiment, acting more as a deterrent to the Fuhrer's ideas than as a support. If we are to rid the Heer from the rats that have burrowed inside it, a purge targeting the very top of the command structure is necessary. Despite possible negative short term effects, the entire Heer - and the entirety of Germany - will be better off without the traitors that call themselves generals and marshals."
GER_Reform_Recruitment_System:0 "Reform the Recruitment System"
GER_Reform_Recruitment_System_desc:0 "The current recruitment system that has been used for many years has begun to show its flaws. Many able-bodied men are not allowed to serve due to anachronistic restrictions, and when training does commence, it is slow and inefficient. This is absolutely unacceptable, and we shall begin a great restructuring process to improve the system. The Reich cannot tolerate this for any longer."
GER_Unify_Regional_Commands:0 "Unify the Regional Commands"
GER_Unify_Regional_Commands_desc:0 "The various regional theatres and army groups of the Heer act not in unison but in conflict with each other. The situation has devolved into a constant battle of bureaucrats and administrators attempting to get more men, more supplies, and more resources into their soldiers' hands, to the detriment of the entire Wehrmacht. We shall finally rectify this error that has been allowed to fester for years by unifying the many regional commands into consolidated command structures, all under the watchful eye of Germania."

Now it is time to reinvent the U-Boat's use in warfare to suit a vastly changed naval environment.\n\nThere have, of course, been some worries as to whether the newfangled carriers of America will prove vulnerable to mere submarines. We have assured the Navy that we will modernize the rest of our forces to provide countermeasures to airpower and advanced strikes - let us hope we can actually follow through..."
GER_Expand_Dockyard_Capacity:0 "Expand Dockyard Capacity"

Just as our tanks and our armies overran one position after another in massed concentrations, so too shall our cruisers and submarines overwhelm the forces of international Jewry through sheer numbers as well!\n\nA little relaxation of safety standards, and rapid expansions in port facilities, will begin this process of expansion. Soon we will have a fleet that shall darken the seabed itself - and the skies will tremble with its firepower."
GER_Refit_Navy:0 "Refit the Navy"
GER_Refit_Navy_desc:0 "It is not enough to build one's way into naval dominance - one must also rebuild the old, for it would be a crime to consign these millions of wasted Reichsmarks to the wastepaper-bin of history. No matter how utterly terrible the Kriegsmarine is in its present state, we can at least salvage the armaments and hulls of our light vessels.\n\nWe will redesign our cruisers and destroyers to serve a lighter, more durable purpose in combat - this should also help with our crippling oil dependence, which will relieve the accountants thoroughly."
GER_Destroyer_Fleet:0 "Destroyer Fleet"
GER_Destroyer_Fleet_desc:0 "We have no need of an offensive fleet: it is a waste of money, a strategic inconvenience, and a drain on our resource deposits. What is needed is a fleet capable of rapid defense of our long shoreline, one that can respond to a variety of targets while retaining a uniformity of operating doctrine.\n\nThe answer to our problems is the destroyer: humble, lightweight, and so versatile the Americans have not yet abandoned it. Around this ship class the new German Navy will revolve!"
GER_Limit_Naval_Spendings:0 "Limit Naval Spendings"
GER_Limit_Naval_Spendings_desc:0 "We have committed to a sleek and downsized naval force, and now we must work to bring it into being. The first step will be downsizing the bloated maintenance budgets of the Navy, cutting forever our ties with the silent horror of the Schiessenflotte. Let us hope these battleships which serve no purpose and can barely stand straight at harbor can at least perform one vital function:\nAn efficient and cheap base for scrap metal."
GER_Submarine_Production:0 "Submarine Production"
GER_Submarine_Production_desc:0 "We have not quite forgotten the workhorses of our Navy, and the Unterseeboot programme is about to get overhauled and its funding expanded beyond its wildest dreams. The submarine must be rethought in every aspect to fit the new world and its frightening new technologies: new engines invented, efficiency increased.\n\nIt is a dream come true for the submarine-experts of the Kriegsmarine, and they will never see the nightmarish accounting arrears that are the cost of pursuing it. Let us pray they will never see the ugly truth."

GER_Invasion_fleet:0 "Invasion Fleet"
GER_Invasion_fleet_desc:0 "The course before us is clear: we cannot long afford to sustain this immense, draining naval buildup. While we have the upper hand in the European seas, we must prepare the Kriegsmarine for offensive operations - the emphasis here will be on quick strikes and overwhelming destruction, delivered so rapidly that the enemy will be ripe for our invasion.\n\nTo do this, sacrifices must be made: a little trimming of building standards will boost our naval buildup even further, and naval doctrinal innovations will be discouraged in favor of relevant planning strategies."
GER_Prepare_for_Sealion:0 "Prepare for Sealion"
GER_Prepare_for_Sealion_desc:0 "It is a blessing of history that we never had to put the abortive Operation Sealion into practice: the Luftwaffe was untested, our fleets were in many areas primitive and unready for shore defense, and our men were, to put it bluntly, utterly unproven. Not this time: we are ready for an actual fight on the shores of Britain.\n\nAs the ships steam out of their yards, as the airplanes buzz ever closer to the coast, as the Navy masses like an iron wave to right an old half-mistake: we are ready to finish where we left off, and we will make sure the Anglos know it."
GER_Naval_Frenzy:0 "Naval Frenzy"
GER_Naval_Frenzy_desc:0 "We have pumped so much into the German naval machine that it forms an integral part of our civilian industry: as ships are churned out month after month, the industry booms with the sound of tens of thousands of workers hammering the Reich's future into being. Why not take this energy and channel it into an economic bubble?\n\nWith a little guided speculation, we will make the industrialists rich, the naval buildup fully sustainable, and the Kriegsmarine as massive as it needs to be! Who cares about long-term affordability? We must look to the Golden Future!"

twrspeergoebbels.1.t:0 "The Kriegsmarine"
twrspeergoebbels.1.d:0 "The forces of the Kriegsmarine didn't pursue open combat with the British during the war, favouring starving the British Isles to break their will. With the British signing a peace treaty in 1941, the focus of the war became the Russian front and with that, token blockades were sent to the Baltic sea. Beyond that, the Kriegsmarine had little else to do to bring Germany victory.\n\nIn initial post-war years, it was deemed necessary for the Kriegsmarine to rival if not overshadow the British Navy and thus, expansion occurred. However, in recent years, it has proven not to be a worthwhile investment. The Americans, veterans of naval warfare from their war with the Japanese, have proven a far greater threat than the British and with their strength combined, Germany cannot match them at sea. So, the Kriegsmarine were left as they were, oversized, outdated and outmatched. This status quo cannot continue if the Reich is to remain dominant."
twrspeergoebbels.1.a:0 "Control the seas!"

twrspeergoebbels.2.t:0 "The Wehrmacht"
twrspeergoebbels.2.d:0 "The Wehrmacht, the infamous ground armies of the German Reich. The years have not been kind to them. It is no secret that during the European War, the forces of Germany were overstretched and at times, close to breaking point. That could not be more true than it was with the Wehrmacht. Through the initially successful Operation Barbarossa, The Russian Insurgency and the numerous scattered land campaigns against the British, French and other allies, the land armies of Germany were well-worn. Manpower shortages at the time were especially concerning. Reich propaganda at the time did its job in hiding it but the Wehrmacht was a wounded, overworked wolf barely capable of fighting for much longer.\n\nIt is little wonder then, that today's Wehrmacht is so content to rest on its accomplishments. After the treaties that secured the Reich's future, the Wehrmacht was left to its own devices. With such effort expended in the war, the hierarchy, training and even discipline of our armies was left stagnant. The same generals, the same officers, the same training. The Wehrmacht fails to adapt to changing times, instead they leverage their greatest victories to excuse any lack of action."
twrspeergoebbels.2.a:0 "The army must change!"

twrspeergoebbels.3.t:0 "The Luftwaffe"
twrspeergoebbels.3.d:0 "The Luftwaffe never got their chance to confront the might of the British Empire over their airspace. But the Luftwaffe did see active duty during the Germans' push into the Soviet Union, covering the airspace, performing aerial bombings and providing important air support for the ground units.\n\nThe Soviet Air Force was no match for the might of our glorious Luftwaffe, but the years of arrogance have caused stagnation in the ranks. Pilots have received less and less trainings as their efficiency declined. While we might still hold some leverage against our enemies, the Luftwaffe is in some dire need of improvement, and must adapt quickly to stay ahead of the the Reich's enemies."

twrgoebbels.1.t:0 "Germany Announces Total War"
twrgoebbels.1.d:0 "The relatively new leader of the German Reich - Joseph Goebbels, organized a grand speech in the heart of Germania with a dozen foreign publications invited to partake in this historic occasion. They were not informed about the speech's true intentions and were utterly shocked when two banners greeted them at the top of the stadium - Totaler Krieg.\nWhen these journalists attempted to leave in a panic, they were stopped by the guards, forced to mark every single word of Goebbels' speech. He warned the Toronto Accord of an impending war, calling any preemptive actions to be foolish and futile, telling the Western democracies to 'enjoy their last days on this Aryan Earth.'.\nPolitical analyzers are certain that this is a bluff, a preemptive move to gain somewhat of an advantage in the negotiations on European hegemony."
twrgoebbels.1.a:0 "Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Führer!"
twrgoebbels.1.b:0 "What a bluff."

twrgoebbels.6666.t:0 "Death of Goebbels"
twrgoebbels.6666.d:0 "Suffering from a number of health complications, Joseph Goebbels was bedridden due to the return of illnesses which plagued him when he was young. Despite the use of elite German doctors, they have failed to cure Goebbels of his illnesses. But during his final days, Goebbels remained delusional and used his time to draft speeches, most of which he planned to use after his inevitable recovery.\n\nBut at last, few hours ago, Goebbels succumbed from a heart attack, dying at the age of 61. Not long after, the Government would make an official statement declaring his death to the German public, and transferred his body to an unknown location.\n\nCurrently, the situation in Germany remains grim, with the question of rather Germany should continue Dr.Goebbels' legacy and political doctrines up for fierce debate."
twrgoebbels.6666.a:0 "Oh no!"
twrgoebbels.6666.b:0 "Huh..."

twrgoebbels.2.t:0 "The Speer Question"
twrgoebbels.2.d:0 "While the Speer-Goebbels Bloc is a product that secured the much needed political stability for Goebbels, it is becoming a larger obstacle for effective administration. Albert Speer was promised high positions of power and a certain amount of influence under Goebbels' leadership, and Speer has proven himself to be an effective minister. However, he is regarded as a flawed individual with faulty concepts on National Socialism, holding beliefs that are the polar opposite of what Goebbels believes in.\n\nWhile Goebbels can indeed, uphold his promises, he can also ignore these promises and assign Speer to some unfavourable, minor position within the Reich."
twrgoebbels.2.a:0 "Assign him as the Economic Minister."
twrgoebbels.2.b:0 "Assign him as...the Minister for Rail or something."

twrgoebbels.3.t:0 "Start of the Goebbels Census"
twrgoebbels.3.d:0 "By understanding the statistics of the German people, the leadership would be able to utilize the gathered data for effective policy executions.\n\nIn short, this census of epic scale will serve as a tool of the regime's control on the masses. With a tightened grip, any groups of political and socially undesirables that slipped through the cracks will be extinguished."
twrgoebbels.3.a:0 "Know our people!"

twrgoebbels.4.t:0 "Honorary Aryans Revoked"
twrgoebbels.4.d:0 "The so called "Honorary Aryans" were people deemed to be above their original ethnicity. While in the eyes of Germany's previous administration, this group of people might have been accepted by the Reich, but Dr.Goebbels has expressed his distaste towards this group of 'Subhumans disguised as Germans'.\n\nThe Honorary Aryan with the highest profile being Emil Maurice, Hitler's first personal chauffeur. Despite Maurice's status and relationship with Adolf Hitler, Goebbels disregarded all of these factors and issued an order to arrest Emil Maurice under the charges of 'Treason'.\n\nIn one of the most notable television event in Germany, Emil Maurice along other Honorary Aryans, such as Stephanie Julianne von Hohenlohe were placed in a collective trial, which the collective verdict was made, declaring that all Honorary Aryans have forfeited their right of survival.\n\nEmil Maurice was executed live on television, with many other leftover Japanese Nationals in Germany being 'expelled' to the Baltic Sea."
twrgoebbels.4.a:0 "They had it coming."

twrgoebbels.5.t:0 "The Aryan Goal"
twrgoebbels.5.d:0 "\"All Aryans must have one common goal in mind: the betterment of their own people.\"\n\nWhile this mindset has been drilled into the brains of German citizens for the past decades, Joseph Goebbels has made this idea absolute, by forever enshrining this ideal in different corners of the Reich, ranging from civilian lives to the inner depths of government departments."
twrgoebbels.5.a:0 "Ein Volk!"

twrgoebbels.6.t:0 "The Rotten People"
twrgoebbels.6.d:0 "Without a doubt, Dr.Goebbels is a strong believer of National Socialism. But in his mind, there are hidden groups within Germany that are inherently rotten, and in this case, Dr.Goebbels made his strong yet subtle statement against the Catholics.\n\nCalling for greater national consciousness, he urged the people to take actions against the common hidden enemies. Within the first hours of this announcement, groups of teenagers have formed squads and have vandalized Catholic properties, engaging in basic discrimination like the actions performed in the early Hitler Regime."
twrgoebbels.6.a:0 "Enemies all around us!"

twrgoebbels.7.t:0 "Expanding the Deutsche Zeichentrickfilme"
twrgoebbels.7.d:0 "The Deutsche Zeichentrickfilme was set up as Germany's alternative to Western animation. While Dr.Goebbels have envisioned animation as an important tool of propaganda, it is until now that he has finally got the chance to fully realize this ambition.\n\nWith ultimate control and his new policies on the youth, Joseph Goebbels can now divert more funds to expand Germany's 'less aggressive' propaganda operations. This meant a great amount of funds were provided to the Deutsche Zeichentrickfilme, allowing them to expand their operations with new, state of the art equipment and the ability to train new talents.\n\nHopefully, Deutsche Zeichentrickfilme can utilize these new resources to preach National Socialism to the youth and combine family entertainment with national values. And ultimately, replacing foreign brands such as Disney as the sole hegemon of animation."
twrgoebbels.7.a:0 "Good!"

twrgoebbels.8.t:0 "The Jugend Panzergrenadiers"
twrgoebbels.8.d:0 "Joseph Goebbels and his confidants see the great potential in turning Germany's youth into professional soldiers. The youth, with their highly flexible. Child soldiers are often more agile than adult soldiers, with the additional benefit of being a smaller target. At times, these children's mind can be freely shaped by our authorities, making them the most loyal elements of the army if they were to be deployed.\n\nWith propaganda efforts and an extensive training programme, the concept of child soldiers are no longer a desperate measure, but a honourable act to serve the fatherland with utmost bravery, forming Germany's first professional Youth Panzergrenadier Divisions. These youthful soldiers are the best of the best that Germany has to offer, trained in many forms of warfare and thoroughly indoctrinated. Ultimately becoming Goebbels' elite divisions."

twrgoebbels.9.t:0 "Militarization of the Youth"
twrgoebbels.9.d:0 "While the German education system is highly militarized, it is still nowhere near the extent that Joseph Goebbels wants. By adding regular military training and strategy studying as part of the regular activity of German schools and the Hitler Youth, all German schoolchildren, both male and female will be transformed into capable fighters of the Reich, able to think strategically and act swiftly when they are required."
twrgoebbels.9.a:0 "Everyone is a fighter!"

twrgoebbels.10.t:0 "The Eternal Führer"
twrgoebbels.10.d:0 "Words such as fate and belief are often used by religious authorities, ones that Joseph Goebbels have despised. But there is one exception, the total devotion towards Adolf Hitler to the level of religious status.\n\nIn the past weeks, Joseph Goebbels has ordered the construction of a great number of 'Hitler shrines' around Germany, encouraging his citizens to outright worship Adolf Hitler and the 'National Socialist Revolution', branding items such as the Blutfahne as borderline sacred. While technically not an attempt of forming a new religion, this style of Hitler worshipping more fanatical than the one seen during Hitler's regime can certainly be described as the Goebbels' very own 'non-religious religion of the Reich'."
twrgoebbels.10.a:0 "Heil Hitler!"

twrgoebbels.11.t:0 "The Census Concludes"
twrgoebbels.11.d:0 "The statistics of our citizens have been gathered and thoroughly analyzed, the ministry have identified thousands of social undesirables, and an additional DNA checking scheme have deemed multiple figures as 'Lesser-Undesirables', while these people are not as undesirable as the Slavic or Jewish people, other forms of lighter sentencing should suffice, such as revoking citizenship or confiscation of wealth.\n\nIt is up to Goebbels to decide what actions should he take with the results gathered from the census, enacting any forms of special citizenship policies based on the data."
twrgoebbels.11.a:0 "We will do something about this."

twrgoebbels.12.t:0 "Severing Ties with the Vatican"
twrgoebbels.12.d:0 "For the longest time, Germany has maintained diplomatic relations with the Holy See. Germany had an active diplomatic mission led by an ambassador to the Vatican, although these diplomatic policies were enacted during the early Hitler Regime.\n\nJoseph Goebbels has made it clear that it is the Führer's will and National Socialism's call to stand up against the corrupted church, and this should include the destruction of any diplomatic ties between Germany and the Holy See, immediately recalling all diplomats of the German Embassy in the Vatican. Without anymore restraints imposed by an uncertain reign, a fanatical ideologue such as Joseph Goebbels will now be able to act as his ideals desired."
twrgoebbels.12.a:0 "The Holy See is corrupted!"

twrgoebbels.121.t:0 "Goebbels Ends the Reichskonkordat"
twrgoebbels.121.d:0 "The Reichskonkordat was signed in 1933 as a treaty negotiated between the Vatican and Nazi Germany, this treaty guaranteed the rights of the Roman Catholic Church in Germany. While this treaty was already a facade to limit Catholic influence in Germany, Joseph Goebbels have taken this act one step further, proclaiming that the treaty that was signed by Franz von Papen with the 34 negotiated articles at the time are now invalid. Stating that \"The values of National Socialism and the will of the people demand the retraction of ancient, defunct policies\", seemingly revoking the negotiated treaty to encourage political violence against the Catholics.\n\nWhile the Holy See has condemned Germany's actions, diplomatic ties are still active between the two."
twrgoebbels.121.a:0 "Goebbels knows the best for his people!"
twrgoebbels.121.b:0 "Of course, Goebbels is in charge!"

twrgoebbels.13.t:0 "The Holy See Requests Aid"
twrgoebbels.13.d:0 "Due to Germany's recent rampant actions against the Catholic Church, the Holy See has requested Italian aid through diplomatic back-channels, expressing that the Holy See is extremely intimidated by Germany's actions as of late. The Vatican is pleaing to Italy, wishing that Rome could issue a strong diplomatic responce to Germany and deter further actions committed by the Nazis against the Catholic authorities.\n\nWhile we might be able to send a statement, we should not expect any sorts of reply from the Germans, as our relationships have greatly deteriorated."
twrgoebbels.13.a:0 "Let the eagle sleep..."
twrgoebbels.13.b:0 "We will issue a token statement."

twrgoebbels.14.t:0 "Italy Responds to Vatican Question"
twrgoebbels.14.d:0 "Italy, no doubt arrogantly dressing itself up as a knight in shining armour, has issued a statement subtly denouncing Germany's recent actions, specifically its decision to break the Reichskonkordat and severing of ties with the Holy See. While no real actions were taken by the Italians, Joseph Goebbels have taken this offence personal, outright ignoring this message and repeatedly insulting the Italian leadership in non-official settings."
twrgoebbels.14.a:0 "We will remember this!"

NAZI_ITALIAN_BEEF_GOEBBELS:0 "§RGoebbels will remember this incident...§!"

twrgoebbels.15.t:0 "The Catholic Struggle"
twrgoebbels.15.d:0 "Shortly after the official endorsement by the government, crowds of Sturmabteilung men and teenage volunteer groups have stormed several Catholic churches across Germany, with Hitler Youth squads violently beating Catholic priests while the police turn a blind eye to the violence.\n\nMeanwhile, in Bavaria and the South, where Catholicism is strongest, Sturmabteilung Squads were ordered to torch a number of local Catholic churches, destroying priceless church posessions. A few Bishops were extrajudicially executed and the streets of Munich flowed with blood, as the Sturmabteilung's effort to intimidate local believers into abandoning their faith."
twrgoebbels.15.a:0 "Those Catholics had it coming!"

twrgoebbels.16.t:0 "Germany Declares War"
twrgoebbels.16.d:0 "Defying the logic of rational decision-making, Joseph Goebbels has declared war on both the United Kingdom and the United States simultaneously during a grand speech in a stadium. Under Goebbels' vision, this is the Aryans' \"Final struggle\", with the fate of the German people resting on the results of this single war.\n\nIn Goebbels' eyes, the corrupted democracies must perish, and the days of uneasy peace with growing decadence shall now end, believing that the German nation will gladly fight until the day these evil powers are wiped off the earth. While the fighting has barely started, the world is once again plunged into a new age of conflict. From a single man's decision, the world is once again set ablaze."
twrgoebbels.16.a:0 "The Totaler Krieg is here!"
twrgoebbels.16.b:0 "This is insane!"

twrgoebbels.17.t:0 "Morning in Germania"
twrgoebbels.17.d:0 "It looks like the Führer's recent military reforms are already yielding positive results. The deluge that swept through the high command has washed all the corruption and treachery away. It was no secret that there were certain insurrectionary tendencies among elements of the Reich's officer corps. While the process of resolving this matter has been difficult and painful, promising new officers are already being pressed to fill the vacancies. From now on, the high command will function more effectively as a collective while being entirely loyal to the Führer."

#SPEER
twrspeerpolitics.1.t:0 "Speer Summons the Gauleiters"
twrspeerpolitics.1.d:0 "Mere weeks after Albert Speer's inauguration as the new leader of Germany, Gauleiters across the Reich have been summoned to Germania for an audience with the leader himself. These Gauleiters have been issued with an ultimatum, demanding their loyal cooperation in exchange for continuing their reign, or face the wrath of the Central Government with no further guarantee on their leadership's safety. As part of Albert Speer's trickery, the exchange between Speer and the Gauleiter of Westphalia-South was deliberately leaked to other ministers, with the leader's aggressive and cold dialogues shattering any former speculations on his soft-spoken nature during the Hitler Era.\n\nWith this, Albert Speer has managed to establish a coalition for political stability, effectively demonstrating himself as a brutal, yet efficient manager of the Greater Reich."
twrspeerpolitics.1.a:0 "Alright."

twrspeerpolitics.2.t:0 "Remembering the Führer"
twrspeerpolitics.2.d:0 "The Führer has passed, but his teachings shall for sure live on. However, the questions remains - should these doctrines lie utterly unchanged? Albert Speer and his new administration is faced by this question - the decision on continuing Hitler's old policies to the letter or to bring new, refreshing policies to keep National Socialism up to date with a changing world while building on Hitler's foundations.\n\nCarrying on Hitler's legacy completely means little to no major reform, maintaining the status quo from the Hitler era, which would surely maintain some level of stability. Some politicians, however, argue that reasonable reforms to the system should not be seen as abandoning Hitlerist ideals, and instead it should be considered a renewing of National Socialism to keep up with the ever-changing current situations."
twrspeerpolitics.2.a:0 "We will follow his example!"
twrspeerpolitics.2.b:0 "It is a new generation."

twrspeerpolitics.3.t:0 "Speer Announces Reforms"
twrspeerpolitics.3.d:0 "Albert Speer was considered by most to be incapable of ruling on his own without the support of the status quo, but his address to the Reich today signalled the start of his so-called 'Reichsreform'. Designed to be a series of reformation across all aspects of the Reich, Albert Speer has declared his determination on "Revitalizing National Socialism within the guides laid by the glorious Führer."\n\nWhile the sense of reform is felt by the address' intended target, political experts on the Nazi Regime suggest that Albert Speer's reforms will not make any impact on the natural character of the brutal policies."
twrspeerpolitics.3.a:0 "Reichsreform is underway!"
twrspeerpolitics.3.b:0 "Reforms? Speer? What a load of bu-"

twrspeerpolitics.4.t:0 "Germany Declares Free Trade"
twrspeerpolitics.4.d:0 "National Socialism advocates for self reliance, an agenda that is contradictory to the freedom of trade. On top of that, the hostile relations between Nazi Germany and the West meant frozen trade partnerships between the world's biggest markets. However, Albert Speer, being the personification of 'Germany's corporate manager' has declared a drastic shift in policy. declaring the policy of "German Free Trade", willing to open the market to any willing trade partners beyond her sphere.\n\nSpeer made it clear that Germany is not straying from Hitlerist ideals, informing his citizens that other policies, such as racial policies will remain unchanged, statinig that these ideals are fundamental to National Socialism."
twrspeerpolitics.4.a:0 "A new era for trade!"
twrspeerpolitics.4.b:0 "Token gestures."

twrspeerpolitics.5.t:0 "The Value of Slave Labour"
twrspeerpolitics.5.d:0 "Since his appointment back in the late 1940s, Albert Speer served as Hitler's favourite engineer and manager. While the Germania Project did not include any slaves as construction workers, Speer utilized a great amount of slave labour to produce the necessary material for his grand structures, and continued the usage of slaves after the plan was completed.\n\nFrom his experience, Speer has realized the true value of slave labour, seeking to expand these programmes even further to enable Aryan workers to perform more skillful tasks, leaving the undesirable positions of society to the slaves. In Speer's plan to expand slave labour, he details the reclassification of slave labourers into assets, which are allowed to be sold to corporations in the near future."
twrspeerpolitics.5.a:0 "Thank you, Speer!"

twrspeerpolitics.6.t:0 "The National Club"
twrspeerpolitics.6.d:0 "Albert Speer, through persuasion and personal connections has managed to gather a group of like-minded individuals to form an informal faction within the NSDAP - the National Club. While this group is technically not an approved political organisation within the party, these ministers and members are willing partners of the Speer regime, willing to discuss policies and provide input directly.\n\nThe National Club includes notable members such as Karl Hanke, Robert Ley and Karl Kaufmann. Influential members of the government on a national and local level. The National Club meets in a unknown clubhouse twice a month, where matters on national level and party issues are addressed and handled. Besides the National Club's devotion to Albert Speer, the group is largely without a set ideology besides their common belief in National Socialism, which every single German possesses."
twrspeerpolitics.6.a:0 "The club is formed!"

twrspeerpolitics.7.t:0 "The Alldeutsche Baufirma"
twrspeerpolitics.7.d:0 "Mimicking the Reichswerke Hermann Göring, Albert Speer has made the decision to form a corporation that defies all regulations, the Alldeutsche Baufirma. This corporation is designed to function as Germany's go-to construction contractor, with their future construction projects being Speer's personal pet projects. All current and future government public projects will be contracted to this company, with material firms required to cooperate when the company requests.\n\nIn classic fashion, the board of directors for this company is made up of Speer's confidants and allies, but structured in a way where efficiency is ensured in the execution branch of the company. This vision is true to most local management positions with one exception, Albert Speer appointed his son, Albert Speer Junior as a secretary, whom has not even finished his education. Demonstrating a nepotistic move to ensure a smooth corporate transfer in the future, preparing for a time when the father finally decides to hand his corporate empire to the hands of his son."
twrspeerpolitics.7.a:0 "It's time for construction works!"

twrspeerpolitics.8.t:0 "Pressure from the Central Government"
twrspeerpolitics.8.d:0 "While Burgundy operates with great autonomy, the central government is now pressuring our administration, in a petty attempt at breaking the Schutzstaffel's unity and cohesion. An unknown number of soldiers and governors have been reported to be standing on the side of the central government in Germania, hinting towards the possibility of an internally orchestrated coup when the signal is given from Germania.\n\nOur ministers have issued a complain to the Central Government, reminding them of the agreed deal during the power struggle."

twrspeerpolitics.9.t:0 "The Nationalsozialistischer Kodex"
twrspeerpolitics.9.d:0 "Under the single vision of immortalizing Hitler, National Socialist scholars, jurists, philosophers were gathered to craft the \"Nationalsozialistischer Kodex\", the magnum opus of National Socialism, a codex designed to be the base of all forms of systems, laws and living under pure, truthful guidelines laid by Adolf Hitler himself.\n\nThe Nationalsozialistischer Kodex will function as a second book of law and a doctrine for all regimes from this point onward. All soldiers, party members and public servants are issued a copy of the Nationalsozialistischer Kodex, as a way for Aryans to remind themselves constantly of National Socialist values."
twrspeerpolitics.9.a:0 "The codex is born!"

twrspeerpolitics.10.t:0 "Abwehr Supremacy"
twrspeerpolitics.10.d:0 "With the relevancy of Schutzstaffel intelligence services diminishing in metropolitan Germany, the bureaucractic chaos that are the German intelligence agencies with their overlapping responsibilities is now on Albert Speer's radar. To cut this disastrous trend, Speer has drafted a plan to further empower the Abwehr, ensuring a centralized intelligence agency with clear goals, and handing the great task of organising intelligence resources to Hans Oster.\n\nWhile this reform was done under the pretext of \"Improving national security\", in reality, Albert Speer simply wants to divert funds to his own projects by cutting down the excessive number of of unnecessary departments within the German system."

twrspeerpolitics.11.t:0 "Defining Germany"
twrspeerpolitics.11.d:0 "On the surface, this issue might appear trivial, but on an administration level, the definition of "Germany" is an important bureaucractic matter that could affect decision making for the residents of these regions. While technically, Germany is vaguely divided by Metropolitan and Colonial regions, these differences were never officially adapted. While Albert Speer might be able to put these existing definitions into government record, his reformist identity might enable him to enact some drastic changes to this border issue, cutting down on bureaucractic confusion and its related costs. By defining the current Reichskommissariat regions as Metropolitan Germany, it will give Germany a legal claim over these Reichskommissariats despite their self governing nature, opening the door of possible expansion for future decisions."

twrspeerpolitics.11.b:0 "All shall be Germany!"

twrspeerpolitics.12.t:0 "Reforming the NSDAP"
twrspeerpolitics.12.d:0 "The Nazi Party is a behemoth with a dozen disparate branches, wings that covers all aspects of life. While its size and complexity is impressive, it has also led to the obvious problems of an overly complicated bureaucractic structure, with unnecessary departments staying afloat due to negligence and corruption. These useless departments with their functionless leaders should not be ignored, and the potential resources savings makes a reorganisation appealing.\n\nOn the other hand, the mess has its own advantages. After all, Hitler creates this complexity so that the many separate departments would serve as an internal version of \"Divide and Conquer\", ensuring the leader is unchallenged. Maintaining this structure may benefit Speer's new rule"

twrspeerpolitics.14.t:0 "The Government Reform"
twrspeerpolitics.14.d:0 "Following the tradition of complicated bureaucracy, the Nazi Government's structure is as complicated as the Nazi Party. With various departments of questionable usefulness, overlapping ministeries and many pseudo-governmental organisations, the German Government is in dire need of some drastic reforms. With millions wasted on defunct departments, Albert Speer shall now fire all unnecessary public servants, dissolve their organisations and merge the remains into bigger departments. For example, the Reich Treasury Office will be merged into the Reich Ministry of Finance, saving the administration some much needed resources to be diverted to necessary projects launched by the Government."
twrspeerpolitics.14.a:0 "Merge it all!"

twrspeerpolitics.15.t:0 "Albert Speer Thought Incorporated"
twrspeerpolitics.15.d:0 "With the Reichsreform successfully enacted, Albert Speer has proven himself to be a capable leader. As a symbol of national confidence and an approval to his administration, a motion was pushed in the Reichstag that sought to incorporate \"Albert Speer Thought\" into official doctrine, which is a broad idea of regularly enacting \"reforms\" to ensure the relevancy of National Socialism on the world stage.\n\nWith a short speech and a brief vote, the Reichstag has provided the rubber stamp to this resolution of incorporating \"Albert Speer Thought\" into the records. While this gesture is largely symbolic, this has cemented Albert Speer's influence as a leader in German history, greatly increasing his legitimacy as Germany's greatest leader right below Adolf Hitler."

Judging by the results and the chaos unfolding in Eastern Europe, Reichskommissariat Osteuropa is a clear failure of epic proportions. This monstrosity is draining much more resources than previous arrangements, proving Alfred Rosenberg as an incapable administrator, unable to maintain the massive colonial body.\n\nHowever, the decentralization of this entity might be useful enough to save us some resources and appease the local settlers. Osteuropa has failed, and in its place, the citizens, local administrators of this behemoth shall now be granted the right to manage themselves.

twrspeerpolitics.17.a:0 "So be it..."

twrspeerpolitics.18.t:0 "Osteuropa Devolved"
twrspeerpolitics.18.d:0 "Commonly known as a nonsensical creation of an idealistic leader, Germania gave the order to dissolve the Reichskommissariat Osteuropa between local groups. While Alfred Rosenberg is still technically the leader of Eastern Europe, he is virtually powerless with the amount of decentralization enacted, demoted to the position of \"Oversser of Eastern Europe Occupation\".\n\nFor now, Eastern Europe is now a \"Confederation\" of local governments, an even larger step away from the Reichskommissariat system that existed before. While this has cleared up a proportion of the bureaucractic confusion, Alfred Rosenberg has been disgraced, embarassing himself with a lackluster administration."

However, with Albert Speer sitting comfortably on the chancellery throne, now, he can push for the end of this project.\n\nWhile the foundation in Berlin is unsuitable for massive constructions, Albert Speer plans to transfer parts of Mark-Brandenburg for the expansion of Welthauptstadt Germania. Outside the Volkshalle, Albert Speer has ordered a gigantic Hitler statue to be built near the heart of Germania, attempting to create Germany's very own version of 'Statue of Liberty'.\n\nIt seems that with Albert Speer, Germania's status as the 'Global City' should be accomplished under his reign."

twrspeercities.101.t:0 "Germania Expansion Completed"
twrspeercities.101.d:0 "Completed in such a short amount of time, the expansion of Germania is worthy of being viewed as a great human achievement. While Germany is known for using slave labour, the expansion of Germania did not conscript any 'Non-Aryan' slave workers, due to the city policy of being a 'purified city'. Instead of being used as construction workers, slave labour was widely used on producing the needed materials for the construction, with the biggest slave factory located in Guben.\n\nOther than the expansion of Metropolitan Germania, the Hitler Statue, named the "Statue of Aryan" stood proudly on the Volksplatz outside of Volkshalle. With a height of 95 meters, it is slightly higher than the Statue of Liberty. While this might be considered petty by some, this is just another way for Germans to express their supremacy over the Americans."
twrspeercities.101.a:0 "Glorious!"
twrspeercities.101.b:0 "Impressive."

twrspeercities.2.t:0 "Speer Announces Versandstadt Plan"
twrspeercities.2.d:0 "After the expansion of Germania, Albert Speer has announced his plans on expanding Hamburg as 'Versandstadt', the Capital of German Shipping. Albert Speer aimed to construct multiple enormous dockyards, with the goal of turning Hamburg into a 'national dockyard'.\n\nWhile these dockyards are designed for military purposes, Speer went an extra mile by handcrafting each dockyards' overall designs. All of these dockyards are designed in a stripped neoclassicism style, with multiple pillars and Nazi victory symbols filling empty spaces. Intriguingly, one of the dockyard's entrance will feature two sets of statues, with one being Adolf Hitler, and the other being a statue of Albert Speer."
twrspeercities.2.a:0 "Heil Hammburg!"
twrspeercities.2.b:0 "Hamburg? Hm."

twrspeercities.202.t:0 "Dawn of the Versandstadt"
twrspeercities.202.d:0 "Versandstadt is no longer merely a honorary city title, but is now a realized dream. Formerly known as Hamburg, Versandstadt serves to be the national dockyard and shipping hub of the Greater German Reich. With a shipping capacity unmatched throughout the world, Versandstadt is the biggest port city in the world.\n\nWhile it might be questionable on rather Versandstadt's shipping needs would ever reach near its capacity, Albert Speer rebuked such doubts by claiming its value in a future situation, calling himself 'the Architect with Foresight'. Nonetheless, Hitler and Speer's statues stare proudly onto the docks of former Hamburg, a constant reminder for these workers about the Führer's divine glory over Greater Germany."
twrspeercities.202.a:0 "Capital of Shipping!"
twrspeercities.202.b:0 "A dockyard with no ships."

twrspeercities.3.t:0 "The Führermuseum"
twrspeercities.3.d:0 "Until the passing of the Führer, his concept of Führermuseum was never truly realized. But with an architect at the helm, Speer has finally finished the Führermuseum project, with all types of Nazi endorsed art pieces being displayed for public viewing, wishing to turn the Führer's hometown, Linz into a cultural capital of Europe. In addition, Speer adjusted this Führermuseum with a mausoleum of Hitler's parents, and the Führer himself.\n\nDue to fact that the public can only witness Hitler's coffin behind a glass chamber, some speculate that the chamber hosts an empty coffin, with the Führer's whereabouts unknown to the people of Germany."
twrspeercities.3.a:0 "Ah, art!"

twrspeercities.4.d:0 "Due to Munich's special status within the Reich, it was awarded two honorary titles by the Führer himself. Known for its significance on German arts and the birth of National Socialism, Albert Speer has ordered the a complete renovation of Munich, hoping to turn it into a masterfully crafted model city.\n\nOne of the highlights of this project decreed by Speer includes a grand sculpture, depicting the martyrs of the Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, sacrificing themselves to the Blood Flag. Speer also planned to have each and everyone of the martyrs' biographies carved onto the foundations of this grand sculpture, as a way to remind Germans about their past struggles before achieving National Socialism."
twrspeercities.4.a:0 "Remember the Martyrs!"
twrspeercities.4.b:0 "Huh, okay."

twrspeercities.5.d:0 "Friedrich Pabst crafted a plan to reshape Warschau into a ideal German city. This plan was ignored by the Hitler Administration, and did not see any progress during his reign. But with Albert Speer as the leader of Germany, the Pabst Plan is finally being realized under Albert Speer's personal directive. Crews of unpaid slave workers and soldiers are now demolishing this old Polish city, trying to replace it with an Aryan city.\n\nUnder the objectives of Pabst Plan, majority of the Polish built neighbourhoods are planned to be completely removed, with all of the local non-Aryan residents expelled from Warschau. A large Parteivolkshalle is to replace the Royal Castle, serving as a major transportation hub of the Greater Reich."

twrspeercities.6.t:0 "Deutsches Stadion"
twrspeercities.6.d:0 "Unprecedented in history, the Deutsches Stadion has been declared 'fully completed' by Albert Speer, taking the title of the world's largest stadium. Deutsches Stadion's design was inspired by the Panathenaic Stadium of Athens, built in a similar style but with a sense of stripped neoclassicism sprinkled around the design. This Stadium has the capacity to hold 405,000 spectators, with five tiers of seats that are fitted with lifts.\n\nAs part of the opening ceremony, Albert Speer witnessed the stadium's first ever event, utilizing Germany's elite groups of soldiers and athletes to organize a grand 'chariot fencing' tournament. In the end, Albert Speer congratulated the winners on a special platform, then made a speech in front crowds and crowds of spectators, calling this stadium 'A new chapter to Germany'.\n\nAfter the ending ceremony, 16 spectators were trampled to death upon exiting."

twrspeercities.7.t:0 "The Nordstern Project"
twrspeercities.7.d:0 "Supported by the Kriegsmarine and by Adolf Hitler himself, Nordstern was planned to become the 'German Singapore', with a heavy focus on naval matters and trade. Despite being a metropolis, Nordstern functions like a naval base with a sizable population, its sole goal is to function as the gateway to North Atlantic.\n\nSituated near Trondheim, Nordstern was put on hold when Germany's economy stagnated, and was finally completed after Albert Speer issued orders to resume the plans. Packed with around 300,000 German settlers, Nordstern's future is bright, and will play a vital role in Germany's control over the Atlantic."

twrgermany.48.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events the Fatherland has requested our immediate subjugation and reintegration into the Reich, Germania has deemed our regime too unstable for self-governance to be considered a viable option and has given us an ultimatum that if no decision is made the army will cross the border and "liberate" the Reichskommissariat. Though many in the administration are not agreeing to the demand as "treason of the highest order" there is a minority in the administration who think these actions are harsh and consider secession as an alternative, this has led the Reichskommisar to call an emergency meeting where after hours of debate the doors of the hall were opened and the words which came out of the Reichskommisar's mouth were: "We shall therefore…""

This has made the government fervent as this recent victory has left their mouth sweet for more victories  as the top brass and army cheer the soldiers on. But some members point out that with our entry violence against Germans has increased shockingly but these worries have been quieted by the cheers as another Reichskommissariat joins the Reich. Only time will tell if these worries are to be taken seriously."

Ultimately, increasing the efficiency of German Eastern Europe."
