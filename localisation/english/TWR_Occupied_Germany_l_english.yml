 ## Focus Tree ##
 SMO_Forming_a_Civilian_Transitional_Cabinet:0 "Forming a Civilian Transitional Cabinet"
 SMO_Forming_a_Civilian_Transitional_Cabinet_desc:0 "The point of our military government is to, eventually, transition to a civilian government, but that will be impossible without a transitional cabinet to handle the necessary matters. As such, we will form a transitional government without delay, and secure the purpose of our occupation."
 SMO_Placing_Ivanov_in_Charge:0 "Placing Ivanov in Charge"
 SMO_Placing_Ivanov_in_Charge_desc:0 "Fyodor Ivanov is a hero of the Great Patriotic War, and high command has decided to place him in full command of the occupation forces. Only time will tell what his administration will be like, but we can rest assured knowing that his loyalty to the Supreme Soviet is unshakeable."
 SMO_Integrating_the_Exiles_into_the_Government:0 "Integrating the Exiles into the Government"
 SMO_Integrating_the_Exiles_into_the_Government_desc:0 "During the Nazi era, many communists and socialists were exiled, by force or by choice, from Germany. These people will prove a valuable asset to both the occupation and the coming civilian government, if only we can properly utilize them. We will gather them in Berlin and integrate them into the transitional process."
 SMO_Token_Reconstruction_Assistance:0 "Token Reconstruction Assistance"
 SMO_Token_Reconstruction_Assistance_desc:0 "Though the German people have not truly earned it, our occupation would admittedly look rather illegitimate if we made no efforts to reconstruct the ruined country that we now occupy. As such, we will offer a token amount of reconstruction assistance to the civilian government and the German people, if only to maintain our public image."
 SMO_Bar_Former_Nazis_from_Leadership:0 "Bar Former Nazis from Leadership"
 SMO_Bar_Former_Nazis_from_Leadership_desc:0 "Those who willingly associated themselves with Hitler's regime cannot be allowed to ever again come near a position of authority. With this in mind, we will prohibit the membership of any and all former Nazis in the German Communist Party."
 SMO_Sign_Treaties_of_Perpetual_Disarmament:0 "Sign Treaties of Perpetual Disarmament"
 SMO_Sign_Treaties_of_Perpetual_Disarmament_desc:0 "We cannot risk what was done by the Germans to the Soviet Union happening ever again, in the near future or the far. This being the case, we will 'suggest' that treaties disarming the German nation in perpetuity be signed, to ensure their mistake is never repeated."
 SMO_A_System_of_Peoples_Militias:0 "A System of People's Militias"
 SMO_A_System_of_Peoples_Militias_desc:0 "Rather than a formal army, to defend the revolution in Germany a system connecting a variety of popular militias will be formed, to allow the people to defend the revolution themselves rather than rely on the government, which has proven in the past so prone to forcing the whole of the world into war."
 SMO_The_Great_Apology:0 "The Great Apology"
 SMO_The_Great_Apology_desc:0 "Naturally, before handing over any real power to the civilian government, we must receive a real apology from it on behalf of the whole of the German people for the unprecedented crimes committed against the peoples of the Soviet Union. This apology will not truly make up for what has been done, but everyone from the average soldier to the heights of high command feels it is owed regardless."
 SMO_The_Formation_of_IMAGE:0 "The Formation of IMAGE"
 SMO_The_Formation_of_IMAGE_desc:0 "Generalplan Ost, and the related Holocaust perpetuated by the Germans against the Jews, was one of history's greatest crimes, and this fact needs to be well documented for future generations. For this effort we will form IMAGE, a commission dedicated to documenting, investigating, and making reparations for any and all crimes relating to this great atrocity."
 SMO_Declare_Racial_Supremacy_Unconstitutional:0 "Declare Racial Supremacy Unconstitutional"
 SMO_Declare_Racial_Supremacy_Unconstitutional_desc:0 "It is critical that we make a core part of the German constitution a prohibition of the ideas of racial supremacy. These views have led to immense suffering, both on our part and that of others, and we should make it as difficult as possible for anyone possessing these cruel and twisted views to rise to power ever again."
 SMO_Request_Observers_from_All_Nations:0 "Request Observers from All Nations"
 SMO_Request_Observers_from_All_Nations_desc:0 "To ensure that the crimes of the Nazi party are as well known from possible, we will invite every nation in the world to send observers to witness the sites of their sickening cruelties; from the gates of the extermination camps to the gas chambers, in all their unholy glory."
 SMO_The_Reichs_Forgotten_Children:0 "The Reich's Forgotten Children"
 SMO_The_Reichs_Forgotten_Children_desc:0 "Another of the disgusting horrors of the Nazi regime, initiated by the SS, was the Lebensborn state-supported association, which aimed to raise the birth rate of "Aryan" children. Initially focused on providing welfare for unmarried mothers considered to be 'racially pure', it later turned to kidnapping 'racially worthy' orphans from orphanages and even from their parents throughout the lands they occupied, leaving them without parents when the Lebensborn program was disbanded at the end of the war. We must now correct this grave offense by finding these poor children, if not parents, then at least orphanages to care for them."
 SMO_Enshrining_Reparations_in_the_Constitution:0 "Enshrining Reparations in the Constitution"
 SMO_Enshrining_Reparations_in_the_Constitution_desc:0 "The reparations owed by Germany to her victims are vast and deep, and we must ensure that she does not ever forget this. To this end, we will enshrine the payment of reparations to victimized nations and peoples in the new constitution, so that Germans not only will not forget, they cannot forget."
 SMO_Monument_to_the_Victims_of_the_East:0 "Monument to the Victims of the East"
 SMO_Monument_to_the_Victims_of_the_East_desc:0 "To commemorate all of the innocent and defenseless fallen of the east of Europe, regardless of race, religion, or creed, we will construct a monument in their memory, and all who look upon it will know now and forever that they did not die for nothing."
 SMO_Foundation_of_the_DVSP:0 "Foundation of the DVSP"
 SMO_Foundation_of_the_DVSP_desc:0 "The Deutsche Versöhnungspartei, or German Reconciliation Party, uniting all socialists and communists of Germany under one roof, has at long last been founded. Obviously, it will serve its greatest role after the occupation actually ends, but for now it will serve as an effective tool for communication between the German people and our occupation forces."
 SMO_Soviet_Assisted_Collectivisation:0 "Soviet-Assisted Collectivisation"
 SMO_Soviet_Assisted_Collectivisation_desc:0 "One area in which we're more than happy to assist the Germans in the transition to communism is the collectivization of agriculture. We will do all we can to quicken the process and ensure as smooth as possible a transition to the socialist agricultural ideal."
 SMO_Liquidating_All_Known_Nazi_Estates:0 "Liquidating All Known Nazi Estates"
 SMO_Liquidating_All_Known_Nazi_Estates_desc:0 "Many Nazis owned vast agricultural estates, some having acquired them after their rise to power, and many others having owned them long before. It matters little. Either way we will liquidate these estates and turn them over to the German people immediately, so that collectivization may proceed and only the former tyrants may suffer."
 SMO_The_Looming_Famine:0 "The Looming Famine"
 SMO_The_Looming_Famine_desc:0 "According to our agricultural experts, there is a famine looming in Germany, and despite their best efforts they cannot figure out why. We must prepare for this eventuality as best we can, for while the Germans may have been determined to starve us when they occupied our lands, we will not return the favor, and do what we can to protect them from any such disaster."
 SMO_Favouring_the_New_Militia_Commands:0 "Favouring the New Militia Commands"
 SMO_Favouring_the_New_Militia_Commands_desc:0 "Within the DVSP, competition between the popular militias and the civilian government has started, and is now all but an open secret. As this is threatening to derail the transition, we have decided to support the popular militias, to ensure the security and defense of the revolution. It is on the ordinary German citizen we can rely to stand by our side, not the intellectual elite, no matter how devoted to communism the latter might seem."
 SMO_Orienting_Towards_Agrarianism:0 "Orienting Towards Agrarianism"
 SMO_Orienting_Towards_Agrarianism_desc:0 "In accordance with the wishes of the militias, we have opted to focus on the agricultural sector of the economy, supporting farmers and peasants at the expense of the urban laborer. This may be unorthodox, but at this time it may be just what Germany needs."
 SMO_United_by_Necessity:0 "United by Necessity"
 SMO_United_by_Necessity_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts to seek a conclusion, infighting continues in the shadows of the DVSP, and further attempts would appear to be a waste of our increasingly limited time. We have done what we can; let the Germans sort it out, so long as they do not do so while we remain here."
 SMO_Favouring_the_Urbanist_Wing:0 "Favouring the Urbanist Wing"
 SMO_Favouring_the_Urbanist_Wing_desc:0 "Within the DVSP, competition between the popular militias and the civilian government has started, and is now all but an open secret. As this is threatening to derail the transition, we have decided to support the Urban wing of the party. After all, the most devoted and decidedly loyal communists have always been found in the city, and to favor the industrial worker is in line with official party theory in any case."
 SMO_Attempting_to_Gain_More_Soviet_Aid:0 "Attempting to Gain More Soviet Aid"
 SMO_Attempting_to_Gain_More_Soviet_Aid_desc:0 "In order to rebuild the destroyed cities of Germany and thereby strengthen the position of the urban party, we will need more aid from the motherland. It is clear we underestimated how much material aid Germany would need, focusing instead on getting revenge wherever we could. This time, we will secure a proper level of aid, and use it to restore the once-great factories of Germany to their former glory."
 SMO_Handling_Known_Werwolf_Associates:0 "Handling Known Werwolf Associates"
 SMO_Handling_Known_Werwolf_Associates_desc:0 "The great final Nazi plan to begin a campaign of resistance to occupation, known as Operation Werwolf, has been the source of much fear both among the ordinary German people and the rank-and-file soldiers. To curtail this fear, we will begin a campaign of imprisonment for any and all figures known to have been associated with Werwolf in any way, from the high to the low."
 SMO_The_Dawn_of_Nihilo_Marxism:0 "The Dawn of Nihilo-Marxism"
 SMO_The_Dawn_of_Nihilo_Marxism_desc:0 "Curiously, the events of our occupation have given rise to a new ideology in Germany, by the name of Nihilo-Marxism. It focuses on eternal toil to right the wrongs done by the nation, with socialist prosperity being unattainable until this is one day done. As this ideology poses no threat to our interests, we have decided to leave it be as we begin to withdraw."
