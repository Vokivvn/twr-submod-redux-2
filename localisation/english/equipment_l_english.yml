While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war.

While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war.

While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war.

While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war.
