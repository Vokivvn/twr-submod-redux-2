 ## Descriptions ##
 Mikhail_Leontovich_desc:0 "Doctor Mikhail Leontovich is a figure whom many claim to support, and yet few understand. Born on February 22nd 1903, to a family of Academics and Mechanics, he learned early in life to value education and science, especially with regards to Politics.  Quickly rising through the ranks of Academia, he became one of the most prominent physicists in the entire USSR, being so well respected that he earned a doctorate without even submitting a thesis. This life course continued during the German-Soviet war, as Mikhail was evacuated east with other prominent scientists. It was then in Perm, that he met Andrei Sakharov, a man whom would become one of his closest friends in the years of Stalin and Kalinin.  Andrei would help Mikhail propose a new Research expedition to central Siberia, to search for better locations for facilities, during which he decided on Irkutsk as a likely candidate.\n\nGood things do not last in Russia however, and Mikhail is no exception. While Mikhail was on a research trip to Irkutsk, Beria became premier of the USSR, after which Sakharov and many other scientists voiced opposition, for which they was declared an enemy of the people. This would be the turning point in Mikhail's life, as Andrei asked him and many other prominent scientists to join him in resisting the last decayed Remnants of the USSR. Many refused, however Mikhail did not, organizing a local cell of the PDR in Irkustk and rising to become the Right hand man of Sakharov. Mikhail now stands as the leader of the PDR in Siberia, and he has a unique opportunity. Zhukov's death has enabled the PDR to emerge from the Shadows, and begin removing the stain of Communism from the land, a scenario which Mikhail will take full advantage of."

 ## Ideas ##
 IRK_The_Only_True_Russian_Democrats:0 "The Only True Russian Democrats"
 IRK_The_Only_True_Russian_Democrats_desc:0 "We stand proudly as bearers of the torch of Freedom in the darkness called Russian Siberia! With our ideas, we can go far and we are well on our way to succeeding. But the obstacle is made up of people of false liberal will, who do not want to give way to full freedom for all the peoples in Russia. The Republic is a perfect example of a false democracy that threatens to subvert what we stand for as true freedom fighters! Only when we manage to defeat them will we be able to declare the successful arrival of democracy in Siberia - and then Russia itself!"
 IRK_The_PDR_Command_in_Siberia:0 "The PDR-Command in Siberia"
 IRK_The_PDR_Command_in_Siberia_desc:0 "We had to transfer all our organizational plans to Siberia because we had no other choice during the collapse of the entire nation, and to be able to regain what was lost, we will have to work hard on it. For now, we are stuck with incompetent personnel as well as a poorly trained army, but over some time, we may be able to get rid of this evil influence that has been thrown at us."
 IRK_Irkutsk_Base_Area:0 "Irkutsk Base Area"
 IRK_Irkutsk_Base_Area_desc:0 "The industrial sector suffered many blows during the constant attacks that the Tuvans carried out on our factories and farms, looting and destroying everything in front of them. A series of these unfortunate events have left a deep mark on our industry, which is in a miserable state, but our experts believe that there is still a small chance that we will succeed and get back on our feet, which were so badly beaten during the Tuvan attacks."
 IRK_The_March_to_Freedom:0 "The March to Freedom"
 IRK_The_March_to_Freedom_desc:0 "The motherland has spent over a millenia under the rule of various tyrannies. From the barbaric Huns, to the ruthless Khans, to the hopeless Tsars, to the blood-red Premiers, Russia has never been free. We, the PDR shall change that, and we shall bring Russia into an age of true freedom, unlike the red pretenders or American puppets. The march for freedom begins..."

 IRK_focus_tree:0 "PDR Command Irkutsk Focus Tree"
 IRK_The_March_for_Freedom_Begins:0 "The March for Freedom Begins..."
 IRK_The_March_for_Freedom_Begins_desc:0 "The time has come to take our stand. We will create a democracy for all of Russia, by all of Russia, from Petrograd to Vladivostok. We will not seek the help of foreign interests, and we will certainly not come to rely on it. Russia will be free from tyranny, both domestic and foreign, or it will die in the effort."
 IRK_And_Its_First_Steps_are_Strong:0 "...And Its First Steps are Strong"
 IRK_And_Its_First_Steps_are_Strong_desc:0 "Our preparations are both thorough and finally complete. The time has come for us to take action and reclaim the rest of the motherland. The state is strong, the party is stronger, and we will force the petty tyrants who have divided Russia for their own interests or those of foreigners to submit to our authority. By any means necessary."
 IRK_Preparing_for_the_Stalinists:0 "Preparing for the Stalinists"
 IRK_Preparing_for_the_Stalinists_desc:0 "The legacy of Joseph Stalin is both vast and endlessly dark. Part of what he left behind are his most fervent followers - those who would subject Russians to the tyranny invented by Marx and Engels, German philosophers who knew nothing of Russia's desires or needs. We will crush these traitors who find themselves in Siberia and free the people in a way that matters."
 IRK_Preparing_to_Push_Even_Further:0 "Preparing to Push Even Further"
 IRK_Preparing_to_Push_Even_Further_desc:0 "The time is fast approaching to liberate the area of Yeniseysk, and we must prepare for this event, so as not to be caught off guard. We will increase the output of armaments and ammunition and move military resources to the border area in order to accomplish this."
 IRK_Reclaiming_the_Yeniseysk_Base_Area:0 "Reclaiming the Yeniseysk Base Area"
 IRK_Reclaiming_the_Yeniseysk_Base_Area_desc:0 "Now that we are finally ready, we will march into Yeniseysk in order to take control of the military bases in the region and liberate Norilsk. Those soldiers of the current occupying regime who do not resist will be spared; but no mercy will be shown to those who seek to deny the people their freedom."
 IRK_Siberia_Under_the_Golden_Elk:0 "Siberia Under the Golden Elk"
 IRK_Siberia_Under_the_Golden_Elk_desc:0 "At last, Siberia is united and free under the proud banner of the PDR. While further liberation of the motherland will have to be put off due to the needs of more immediate concerns, such as rebuilding from the Siberian unification, this is a great achievement not only for the PDR but for all Russians."
 IRK_Overhauling_the_Command_Structure:0 "Overhauling the Command Structure"
 IRK_Overhauling_the_Command_Structure_desc:0 "While the fighting in Siberia resulted in a great victory for us, we admittedly could have done better, and our failings can be attributed in large part to the outdated and relatively ineffective military command structure. Before engaging in further wars where such mistakes could be a matter of life and death, we will overhaul the command and make it more suitable to our purposes."
 IRK_The_One_Per_Family_Rule:0 "The One-Per-Family Rule"
 IRK_The_One_Per_Family_Rule_desc:0 "After having faced many years of harsh conscription, in addition to the hideous mortality rates many Russian soldiers have met with, too many families are left tired and angry from worrying about their sons and fathers. We will create a new, streamlined conscription system that limits this necessary evil to only one man from each family."
 IRK_Extend_Basic_Training_Length:0 "Extend Basic Training Length"
 IRK_Extend_Basic_Training_Length_desc:0 "Now that we have reformed our conscription system, we have both the ability and need to extend the basic training time of our soldiers. Rather than a massive, sweeping army from the days of old, we shall focus on a smaller, yet more elite and modern army to serve and protect the Russian people."
 IRK_Maintain_the_Armys_Autonomy:0 "Maintain the Army's Autonomy"
 IRK_Maintain_the_Armys_Autonomy_desc:0 "While sweeping administrative reforms are of course needed, it would be wisest to allow military autonomy from the civilian government to remain in the new command structure. We cannot afford a confrontation with the army leadership at present, and in any case our present military leaders likely know more about matters of war than any civilian oversight would."
 IRK_Found_the_Irkutsk_Guerrilla_Academy:0 "Found the Irkutsk Guerrilla Academy"
 IRK_Found_the_Irkutsk_Guerrilla_Academy_desc:0 "Our army is effective at holding the line against all manner of the people's enemies, but should they falter, or when they advance, there were inevitably be a need to combat the enemy behind the lines. To this end we will found the Irkutsk Guerilla Academy, to train promising recruits in the developing arts of insurgency and counterinsurgency."
 IRK_Bring_Pokryshev_to_Heel:0 "Bring Pokryshev to Heel"
 IRK_Bring_Pokryshev_to_Heel_desc:0 "Pokryshev's socialist tendencies are unacceptable in our new state, and he must be stopped and his influence curtailed before it is too late. We will send him an ultimatum demanding that he resign, and in so doing will bring the army back under civilian control to protect the people's democracy."
 IRK_Retire_Former_Red_Army_Officers:0 "Retire Former Red Army Officers"
 IRK_Retire_Former_Red_Army_Officers_desc:0 "Now that Pokryshev has been forced out, there is little stopping us from conducting a sweeping review of the political affiliations, past and present, of our officers. Those with too many ties to the Red Army in particular and the communist ideology in general will be forced out of their posts, whether by resignation or demotion. This will hurt the capabilities of our army in the short run, but in the long run will ensure the security of our state."
 IRK_Formation_of_the_National_Guard:0 "Formation of the National Guard"
 IRK_Formation_of_the_National_Guard_desc:0 "To protect the people from both civil disturbances and natural disasters, a special military branch known as the National Guard will be formed, ensuring stability at home even as the rest of the military protects the people and state at the front."
 IRK_A_New_Rifle_for_a_New_Russia:0 "A New Rifle for a New Russia"
 IRK_A_New_Rifle_for_a_New_Russia_desc:0 "As the years since the great war with the Germans have worn on, the rifles used by Russian soldiers have grown increasingly outdated and comparatively ineffective. To correct this situation, we will ask the talented weapons designer Sergei Simonov to improve on abandoned early designs for an assault rifle for us, and produce a new line of guns for our men based on his new design. In his honor, we will call the rifle the Avtomat Simonova, or AS."
 IRK_The_Transitional_Period:0 "The Transitional Period"
 IRK_The_Transitional_Period_desc:0 "Now that we have united much of Siberia under the PDR banner, the time for beginning the transition to a true people's democracy has come. We have established a relatively strong and stable state, so it might create worry and division among even our proudest supporters if we do not begin to grant more freedoms. The only question that remains is just how much democracy it would be wise to give..."
 IRK_Drawing_Up_Districts:0 "Drawing Up Logistics"
 IRK_Drawing_Up_Districts_desc:0 "Before anything else, we must figure out how best to distribute electoral resources such as ballots and polling stations. We must also figure out the distribution of the population based on what limited information we have for the purpose of drawing up electoral districts. This will be no easy task, but it is absolutely crucial for a democracy of any sort."
 IRK_Creating_Electoral_Logistics:0 "Creating Electoral Logistics"
 IRK_Creating_Electoral_Logistics_desc:0 "Now that we are done with the planning stage, it is time for the implementation. Using what infrastructure remains, we will distribute the resources necessary for proper voting and establish electoral divisions in fact as well as name."
 IRK_Fair_Voting_Laws:0 "Fair Voting Laws"
 IRK_Fair_Voting_Laws_desc:0 "With the population of our lands prepared to vote, clearer and fairer voting rights legislation is obviously needed to prevent any confusion that can be prevented. We will enact these laws and do as much as we can to make sure they are widely known by voters."
 IRK_The_PDR_Platform:0 "The PDR Platform"
 IRK_The_PDR_Platform_desc:0 "With our electoral system in the works, the people deserve to know what, exactly, the PDR stands for. While we broadly agree on most things, certain important details have been the cause of significant debate within the party. It is time for party leaders in Siberia to step in and put the arguments to rest, at least for the time being."
 IRK_Sakharovs_Pure_Idealism:0 "Sakharov's Pure Idealism"
 IRK_Sakharovs_Pure_Idealism_desc:0 "We will side with those promoting the ideals of the party founder, Andrei Dmitriyevich Sakharov, which call for the establishment of a truly free and fair democracy regardless of the risks. While more cautious and conservative elements of the party will disapprove, it is the only just path for us to take."
 IRK_Dashed_by_Taiga_Winds:0 "Dashed by Taiga Winds..."
 IRK_Dashed_by_Taiga_Winds_desc:0 "Unfortunately, due to a combination of a continued crippling lack of electoral infrastructure despite our best efforts, and a general ignorance of and apathy towards democratic principles by the average voter, the results of our attempt to implement Andrei Dmitriyevich's ideals were not very representative at all. At the very least, we can attempt to salvage what we can of this democratic effort."
 IRK_The_Road_to_Hell_is_Paved:0 "The Road to Hell is Paved..."
 IRK_The_Road_to_Hell_is_Paved_desc:0 "Noble as Andrei Dmitriyevich's principles might be, they are impossible to implement at the current time and in the present situation. True democracy will not be presented to the people for their participation until the party believes they are ready for it."
 IRK_With_Sincere_Intentions:0 "...With Sincere Intentions"
 IRK_With_Sincere_Intentions_desc:0 "While any true semblance of democracy will be put off for the time being, at the very least we can prove to the people that we only want the best for them. A good first step towards this would be to make a concerted effort towards a clean government and allowing natural human freedoms, democratic ones aside."
 IRK_Begin_Planning_the_Election:0 "Begin Planning the Election"
 IRK_Begin_Planning_the_Election_desc:0 "With the structure of democracy in place, we are fully prepared to begin planning the election itself. Details such as who will be allowed to run, how voting will proceed, and what our party stands for have all been decided; all that remains is to set in place the ability to carry these precious things out."
 IRK_A_Letter_to_Sakharov:0 "A Letter to Sakharov"
 IRK_A_Letter_to_Sakharov_desc:0 "Now that we have secured our position, so far as we can secure it, we will send a letter to Andrei Dmitriyevich in the west, and ask for his advice on and clarification of certain issues in the party programme. After all, who else would know the true vision of the PDR better than its founder?"
 IRK_Form_the_Intelligence_Bureau:0 "Form the Intelligence Bureau"
 IRK_Form_the_Intelligence_Bureau_desc:0 "To secure our interests in the increasingly important field of military and civilian intelligence, we will form the Intelligence Bureau, meant to spy on enemies of Russian democracy both abroad and at home. Though their foreign usefulness may be currently limited due to our position, and though some worry of their interference with party principles, we can rest better knowing that they keep true threats to democracy out of the picture."
 IRK_Await_Sakharovs_Response:0 "Await Sakharov's Response"
 IRK_Await_Sakharovs_Response_desc:0 "We will continue to await Andrei Dmitriyevich's response before taking any drastic action. After all, the history of political parties shows just how often crucial principles have been misinterpreted; we could hardly call ourselves loyal to his vision for Russia if we betrayed it in such a way."
 IRK_Move_Ahead_as_Planned:0 "Move Ahead as Planned"
 IRK_Move_Ahead_as_Planned_desc:0 "We don't have any more time to receive Andrei Dmitriyevich's response. We will move ahead regardless, for the sake of national security, and put forth our own understanding of the issues to resolve any problems within our territory."
 IRK_Locate_Weapons_Caches:0 "Locate Our Weapons Caches"
 IRK_Locate_Weapons_Caches_desc:0 "Early on, we stored many weapons in caches, both for later use if we succeeded and as a last resort, to be used in a desperate insurgency. Fortunately for us, it is the former case, rather than the latter, that holds true now. We will collect information on the locations of these caches, find them, and put all those valuable guns to good use."
 IRK_A_Union_Forever_Divided:0 "A Union Forever Divided"
 IRK_A_Union_Forever_Divided_desc:0 "Though Siberia is under our flag, the Russian homeland remains divided, with the east and west under the grip of national traitors and enemies of democracy. We will liberate Russia, free all Russians, no matter what must be done to achieve this."
 IRK_The_Sickle_Falls_the_Elk_Rises:0 "The Sickle Falls, the Elk Rises"
 IRK_The_Sickle_Falls_the_Elk_Rises_desc:0 "The time has come to crush the Soviets in the west and bring true liberation to the people there. Mighty as the sickle and hammer has proven to be, the elk will be yet stronger and crush the hated communists, or die trying."
 IRK_Seek_Out_Buryat_War_Veterans:0 "Seek Out Buryat War Veterans"
 IRK_Seek_Out_Buryat_War_Veterans_desc:0 "To supplement our army in the coming days, we will need veterans of the war in Buryatia to serve as soldiers and officers for the PDR. They proved themselves in battles time and time again, and now, they will continue to do so for the cause of the PDR."
 IRK_The_Final_Steps_of_Freedoms_March:0 "The Final Steps of Freedom's March"
 IRK_The_Final_Steps_of_Freedoms_March_desc:0 "The revolting government in Vladivostok to our east is nothing but a grouping of corrupt foreign puppets and backwards reactionary terrorizing the people and enriching themselves off national riches. We will put an end to this pathetic sham and free the far east once and for all."
 IRK_A_Russia_Not_Red_or_White:0 "A Russia Not White or Red"
 IRK_A_Russia_Not_Red_or_White_desc:0 "With the bolsheviks to the west and the reactionaries to the east both crushed by the inexorable march of progress, Russia is at last reunited under one banner. What will come of this remains to be seen, but for now, this is unquestionably a great day of celebration."
 IRK_Soldiers_of_Global_Democracy:0 "Soldiers of Global "Democracy""
 IRK_Soldiers_of_Global_Democracy_desc:0 "With the people united under our banner, it is finally time to look outwards, for a valuable and loyal ally is worth much more than all the money in the world. In this, we are faced with a choice; will we choose to stand with the lovers of freedom in the Toronto Accord, or align ourselves with those with similar views to us down in China?"
 IRK_Democratising_the_Former_RKs:0 "Democratising the Former Reichskommissariats"
 IRK_Democratising_the_Former_RKs_desc:0 "An important step in the recovery process for our beloved motherland and those younger nations under her protection is teaching them democratic principles of the sort we follow, so that they might grow and thrive in relative liberty and free thought. A people so long oppressed must be taught how to be free."
 IRK_Condemn_the_Toronto_Accord:0 "Condemn the Toronto Accord"
 IRK_Condemn_the_Toronto_Accord_desc:0 "The Toronto Accord, for all its many touted freedoms, is a sham and has as many flaws as it does supposed principles. As it failed Russia with its foolish and arrogant occupation, so too will it fail the rest of the world. No more."
 IRK_Look_Towards_Chiangs_Policies:0 "Look Towards Chiang's Policies"
 IRK_Look_Towards_Chiangs_Policies_desc:0 "Chiang Kai-shek us both a clever military leader and a wise politician, and now it is time to rely on the latter of those two qualities. We will adopt those of his policies aiming to construct a carefully guided and mature democracy that are effective, and discard the rest."
 IRK_A_Mission_to_Mongolia:0 "A Mission to Mongolia"
 IRK_A_Mission_to_Mongolia_desc:0 "Mongolia has long been trapped between the Russian and Chinese spheres of influence, and that has not changed. Whether or not we forgive the Accord or stand hand in hand with China, we should send diplomats to meet with Mongolian leaders, to sway them once more to our side."
 IRK_An_Anti_Western_Korea:0 "An Anti-Western Korea"
 IRK_An_Anti_Western_Korea_desc:0 "Together with China, a Korea sympathetic to the west would not be in our best interests due to its crucial strategic location. We will therefore use our influence in any way possible to sway Korea towards a government more amenable to our vision."
 IRK_Sealing_Our_European_Border:0 "Sealing Our European Border"
 IRK_Sealing_Our_European_Border_desc:0 "We have had quite enough ruination coming towards us from Europe, and we owe the Russian people a guarantee that they will not experuence it again in their lifetimes. We will seal our European border to ensure strong security to deter any attempts at a repeat of our humiliation for the time being."
 IRK_A_Hatred_Best_Left_Aside:0 "A Hatred Best Left Aside"
 IRK_A_Hatred_Best_Left_Aside_desc:0 "Despite the anger of many Russians towards the Toronto Accord for their mistakes, they are by far the best hope for a brighter future for the world, despite our many differences. We will work to establish closer ties with them."
 IRK_Condemning_Chinese_Autocracy:0 "Condemning Chinese Autocracy"
 IRK_Condemning_Chinese_Autocracy_desc:0 "Ironic though it may be, given our currently similar policies, unlike us the Chinese government clearly has no intention of eventually ending their autocratic form of government. We therefore have no choice to condemn such permanent despotism, in the interests of a brighter future for the region."
 IRK_Lock_Down_the_Eastern_Border:0 "Lock Down the Eastern Border"
 IRK_Lock_Down_the_Eastern_Border_desc:0 "With our new alignment with the Toronto Accord, China has become an existential danger to us. We will therefore close our eastern border as a preemptive measure; Russians sing of freedom, so we do not dare blink and allow Chinese despotism to crush them underfoot."
 IRK_Warming_Relations_With_Finland:0 "Warming Relations With Finland"
 IRK_Warming_Relations_With_Finland_desc:0 "Despite the many struggles between Russians and Finns in the past decades, governments have come and gone on both sides, and now we feel it is time to bury the hatchet. Finland is forever gone from Russian rule; so what? We now bid it a belated farewell, and welcome a brother to our side."
 IRK_Plastering_Russias_Scars:0 "Plastering Russia's Scars"
 IRK_Plastering_Russias_Scars_desc:0 "The Great Patriotic War devastated western Russia beyond compare. There are just too many stories of fathers murdered, husbands killed in one of innumerable battles, of sons dead in unmarked graves. We must do all we can to heal these scars. This work will not be done in our time, or even by the next generation of national leaders, but it is a healing that must be pursued even so."
 IRK_Sakharovs_Economics_Put_to_the_Test:0 "Sakharov's Economics Put to the Test"
 IRK_Sakharovs_Economics_Put_to_the_Test_desc:0 "At last, we have a chance to prove the worth of Andrei Dmitriyevich's economic genius. His designs, made since long before our unification of the motherland, focus on the reconstruction of devastated economic fields, a local and more decentralized economic market, and increased private land ownership for small entrepreneurial ventures. In time, this plan will prove to be Russia's greatest hope."
 IRK_Begin_Family_Land_Grants:0 "Begin Family Land Grants"
 IRK_Begin_Family_Land_Grants_desc:0 "In line with PDR economic planning, we will begin the granting of unoccupied land to trustworthy landless families, to encourage these families to develop the land and thereby contribute to the wellbeing of the national economy."
 IRK_Prioritise_the_Victims_of_Fascism:0 "Prioritise the Victims of Fascism"
 IRK_Prioritise_the_Victims_of_Fascism_desc:0 "Before anyone else, we must prioritise aid to and recovery of the victims of fascism, those persecuted the most by the Nazi regime. In addition to the righteousness of such an act, these people are a tough, adaptable sort who are perfect as a conduit for the implementation of our economic policies. Most of all, their hatred of the Germans and their allies ensures that we can count on their future loyalty."
 IRK_Aid_from_Scandinavia:0 "Aid from Scandinavia"
 IRK_Aid_from_Scandinavia_desc:0 "Though some resent the previous poor relations between Scandinavia and Russia on the eve of and even during the Nazi invasion, the fact is that times have changed. We will ask for aid from free Nordic nations in our rebuilding efforts, and in exchange they will receive a much more amenable market for investment to their east."
 IRK_Focusing_on_Reconstruction:0 "Focusing on Reconstruction"
 IRK_Focusing_on_Reconstruction_desc:0 "Above all, the key obstacle to developing our economy further is the sheer devastation wrought by Nazi depredations. We must focus as many of our efforts as we can spare on reconstruction, to remove this obstacle and free our businesses to develop the economy we all share further."
 IRK_A_European_Hell:0 "A European Hell"
 IRK_A_European_Hell_desc:0 "Much as we may try to rebuild, we must realize that the Nazis made Eastern Europe into nothing short of a European hell. The scale of the war and brutality of the occupation are without precedent or peer in European history. This effort will take time, and so we must wait patiently."
 IRK_The_Industrial_Allotment_Programme:0 "The Industrial Allotment Programme"
 IRK_The_Industrial_Allotment_Programme_desc:0 "To encourage industrial recovery and development, we will reserve certain lands for certain industries, giving it out to economic titans and brilliant entrepreneurs entering the industry alike.

 irkutsk.1.t:0 "Entering Yeniseysk"
 irkutsk.1.d:0 "Soldiers of the PDR in Irkutsk have been spotted heading north, in the direction of the Yeniseysk base area, in what is believed to be a precursor to an invasion by the PDR of Yeniseysk. Though this has raised alarm bells in some corners of Russia as to the military capabilities of the PDR, and neighboring states are beginning to make preparations of their own just in case, none have offered aid to Yeniseysk and so it is expected by many that the region will fall rather easily to the PDR."
 irkutsk.1.a:0 "The march goes on."
 
 irkutsk.2.t:0 "A Destroyed Homeland"
 irkutsk.2.d:0 "That the peoples of Russia have been through tough times is an understatement. The turmoil of the Civil War of the 1920s wrecked the country and led to famine and misery, and barely a decade later, the Nazis caused the temporary collapse of our nation and destruction on a scale that eclipsed even the civil war. Generations have grown old knowing only a world where life in Russia has been tough to the point of hellish, as we have fought for our very survival against forces that would see us exterminated.\n\nToday, the Russian nation and economy still lies in complete tatters, utterly destroyed by the decades of revolution, war, famine and genocide. The road to recovery will be long and difficult, and much must be done, if Russia is once again to rise."
 irkutsk.2.a:0 "We have much to do."
 
 irkutsk.3.t:0 "Overhauling the Command Structure"
 irkutsk.3.d:0 "At present, the command of the army of the PDR is highly decentralized and based on the cooperation of individual militias, each with their own leaders and wants. Many within the PDR agree that reforms need to be made to improve the effectiveness of our soldiers as a fighting force, but there is much disagreement over what form these reforms should take. Particularly, a faction led by Pyotr Pokryshev calls for continued autonomy within the army, merely reformed to improve the level of cooperation and coordination, while many others criticize and oppose this and call for a consolidation and centralization of the army. Neither side has been able to gain majority support, and so the choice hangs in the balance."
 irkutsk.3.a:0 "Let's get down to business, to defeat the Huns!"
 
 irkutsk.4.t:0 "The Transitional Period"
 irkutsk.4.d:0 "As our state grows larger, many people have begun to question, and increasingly resent, its nature as a military and militia-based government. While this form of strict governing served us well in our early days, it is admittedly becoming more of a hindrance and in any case is contrary to our party principles. As such, many within the PDR have called for a transition, swift if possible but carefully guided, from our current mode of governance to a more democratic society. Though this process will take a great deal of effort, both to please the people and to live up to our ideals, it is necessary."
 irkutsk.4.a:0 "A new dawn is upon us!"
 
 irkutsk.5.t:0 "The Reality of the Situation"
 irkutsk.5.d:0 "Although many of those who rally under the banner of the PDR possess genuine hope for democratic freedoms and sovereign republican ideals, there are also many with a more cynical view of the situation we find ourselves in. These include important businessmen, political leaders, and bureaucratic heads who not only believe that Russia is unready for a 'full' democracy, but also that such a system would be actively harmful to Russian national prosperity in the present day. They see threats to Russian sovereignty around every corner, and will sacrifice much of the liberty promised by the PDR to secure Russia against foreign interests. Whether right or wrong, this group is an absolutely vital element of the PDR, and it must be made sure that their wants are taken into account."
 irkutsk.5.a:0 "The people must be protected - from themselves."
 
 irkutsk.6.t:0 "A Letter to Sakharov"
 irkutsk.6.d:0 "With our chances of reunifying the Russian motherland becoming more significant every day, we must not forget our origins. Dear Andrei Dmitriyevich Sakharov founded our great party, but he is unable to be with us at this hour; he is in red hands, in Perm. However, that will not put a stop to our efforts to communicate with him. We have seen to it that a letter is sent to Sakharov, discreetly and without the interference of the reds. With his reply, we shall know the true path forwards, to our motherland's great and bountiful future!"
 irkutsk.6.a:0 "Let's hear what our dear friend has to say."
 
 irkutsk.7.t:0 "A Letter to Sakharov"
 irkutsk.7.d:0 "Recently, we have received information of movements against us by the PDR to our east. We know that there is reportedly a letter being sent to the imprisoned leader of the PDR in our territories, Andrei Sakharov. The letter, supposedly asking for his advice in determining the political future of the PDR government, runs a great risk of threatening us if we let him respond to it. How should we react to this attempted interaction?"
 irkutsk.7.a:0 "Kill the courier. We won't take such a chance."
 irkutsk.7.b:0 "Let it be, what harm could an intellectual do behind bars?"
 
 irkutsk.8.t:0 "A Letter from Sakharov"
 irkutsk.8.d:0 "While we have received a response from dear Andrei Dmitriyevich, it seems that this letter is not truly his own. The letter, calling for a strongly limited executive government, the immediate introduction of multi-party politics, and abolition of the death penalty. No comrade of the PDR would support such things - these are acts of communist manipulation in order to bring us to ruin! This forgery shall be immediately discarded, and we shall continue with our rule, just as Andrei Dmitriyevich would desire."
 irkutsk.8.a:0 "And to think we could've been fooled by those reds..."
 
 irkutsk.9.t:0 "A Reunified Russia"
 irkutsk.9.d:0 "At long last, Russia has today been reunified under the banner of a formerly obscure political party known as the PDR. For years they struggled and labored to bring every part of Russia under the authority of their government, and now they have finally succeeded. The PDR calls for the establishment of a 'sovereign democracy' in Russia, calling for strong state power and the elimination of the influence of foreigners and extremists, such as Americans and communists, over politics. While admired in some circles for their commitment to stability and sound economic policy, they have been harshly criticized by many, particularly from America, for the lack of true political liberties and popular participation in their form of democracy. Regardless, many Russians celebrate the end of a period of strife and bloodshed within Russia that led to the deaths of many."
 irkutsk.9.a:0 "Vperyod!"
 
 irkutsk.10.t:0 "The Temporary Occupation"
 irkutsk.10.d:0 "In the lands once administered by the brutal Nazi Reichskommisariats, Russia as led by the PDR now holds authority, and has inevitably been faced with the question of what to do with the peoples in these places, many of whom hold little love for or even resent Russia for a painful history with the country, even as they appreciate their liberation from Nazi occupation. The PDR seems to finally have come to a consensus, placing the lands under temporary military governments to teach the various peoples democratic principles to aid them in forming sovereign democratic states. Some international observers, however, have questioned just how temporary these occupations are, and just how much freedom will come with the form of democracy being taught..."
 irkutsk.10.a:0 "Freedom is not a sprint, but a marathon."
 
 irkutsk.11.t:0 "Russia Condemns the Toronto Accord"
 irkutsk.11.d:0 "The new Russian government under the PDR has, despite hopes on our part, seemingly not taken a liking to the Toronto Accord. In announcements set out by their foreign affairs ministry, Russia has criticised the TA, denouncing it as simply existing to further the hegemony of the United States and being a form of western imperialism.\n\nNo doubt relations between Russia and our alliance have hit a rough period."
 irkutsk.11.a:0 "The Russians can think what they like."
 
 irkutsk.12.t:0 "Russia Condemns Our Government"
 irkutsk.12.d:0 "The new Russian government under the PDR has, despite hopes on our part, seemingly not taken a liking to us. In announcements set out by their foreign affairs ministry, Russia has criticised the Chinese government, citing border disputes and our apparently aggressive ambition for control over Asia as reasons for such condemnation.\n\nNo doubt relations between Russia and China have hit a rough period."
 irkutsk.12.a:0 "The Russians can think what they like."
 
 irkutsk.13.t:0 "Closer Relations with Russia?"
 irkutsk.13.d:0 "The new PDR government of Russia has approached us with offers of rebuilding and improvement of relations between our two nations.\n\nOf course, we have had negative experiences with the Russians in recent memory, so many more nationalistic voices within our country would be opposed to such negotiations. They are, however, under a totally new government, and those in support of closer relations argue that repairing relations with Russia would allow tensions over our wartime acquisitions to be reduced and our security situation to be improved.\n\nHow should we respond to this offer?"
 irkutsk.13.a:0 "It's worth talking to them."
 irkutsk.13.b:0 "No negotiations with Russians!"
 
 irkutsk.14.t:0 "Finland Agrees to Closer Relations"
 irkutsk.14.d:0 "Good news from Helsinki, as the Finnish government has agreed to our offer of mending and improving relations between our two parties. Negotiations will go ahead, and our two nations will grow closer together."
 irkutsk.14.a:0 "Excellent!"
 
 irkutsk.15.t:0 "Finland Refuses Closer Relations"
 irkutsk.15.d:0 "Bad news has arrived from Helsinki - unfortunately, despite our best efforts to open diplomatic channels and repair and improve our relations with Finland, the Finnish government has politely rebuffed our offers and refused for any improvement of relations at this time. Our diplomatic mission to Finland unfortunately seems to have failed."
 irkutsk.15.a:0 "Unfortunate..."
 
 irkutsk.16.t:0 "Sakharovism, Put to the Test"
 irkutsk.16.d:0 "The revered founder of our party, Andrei Sakharov, has presented us with the economic plans he has drawn up in accordance with his political philosophy. These plans mainly revolve around promoting the rebuilding and further development of industry, active protection of Russian trade interests, and promoting the exploitation, use, and development of land by families dispossessed by the wars. Other parts of his programme include integration of territory forcibly annexed by us through fighting, and replacement of German colonists with people of displaced and ethnically cleansed ethnicities to ensure the loyalty of the west in business dealings to the national interest. This plan has proved largely popular among all factions of the party, although only time will tell how effective it truly is."
 irkutsk.16.a:0 "Let's get to work."
 
 irkutsk.17.t:0 "Russia Requests Economic Aid"
 irkutsk.17.d:0 "As Russia works to recover from its long period of warlordism and under the boot of Nazi colonialism, the new Russian government has approached ours, requesting economic aid for its reconstruction. Accepting would be of little immediate benefit to Sweden, but helping in Russia’s reconstruction could give us significant good will in the minds of the Russian people."
 irkutsk.17.a:0 "We will do what we can to help."
 irkutsk.17.b:0 "We must concentrate on our own issues."
 
 irkutsk.18.t:0 "Swedish Aid Arrives"
 irkutsk.18.d:0 "The Swedish government generously accepted our request for economic aid. Shipments have become to arrive from Sweden, which will help facilitate our reconstruction."
 irkutsk.18.a:0 "Thank you, Sweden!"
 
 irkutsk.19.t:0 "Sweden Refuses to Send Aid!"
 irkutsk.19.d:0 "The Swedish government has unfortunately refused to send aid for our economic reconstruction, citing domestic economic concerns."
 irkutsk.19.a:0 "What a shame."
 
 irkutsk.21.t:0 "Building a Better Future"
 irkutsk.21.d:0 "The first half of the 20th century has been a time of chaos and hardship for Russia. From the Great War, to the civil war, to the Nazi invasion and decades spent with the west of the country under Nazi colonial domination, the Russian nation and economy has been held back by half a century of crisis.\n\nThis must, and will, now come to an end. Under our new government, Russia will rise from the ashes, our economy will be rebuilt and the lives of our people improved. The basis of any country is its economy, and ours has been ruined by decades of crisis and neglect. We must make sure this government is united in its mission to build a new and powerful Russian economy, not just to provide for its people, but also so that Russia can once again compete as a great economic power on the world stage and never be threatened by foreign domination again!"
 irkutsk.21.a:0 "Vperyod!"

 irkutsk.20.t:0 "Smolensk Conference"
 irkutsk.20.d:0 "With former warlords and soldiers gathering in Smolensk, a confernce discussing the liberation of all Russia was successfully held. In this, a clear strategy has been deviced, and all these former fighters of different Russias will now come together as one to face the one true enemy - the Germans."
 irkutsk.20.a:0 "Slava!"
 
 irkutsk.22.t:0 "The First National Elections"
 irkutsk.22.d:0 "The very first national elections administered by the PDR, held in every corner of Russia with an unprecedented level of reach for a Russian election, are being held today. Despite significant criticism from international observers over the authoritarian aspects of the PDR's sovereign democracy, and the embarrassment of several public incidents occurring of security forces arresting outspoken opposition politicians, the elections otherwise proceeded smoothly, and with a remarkable lack of public violence. The vote counting that occurred afterwards proceeded with even less incident, and admirers of the PDR praise this as a sign of a new age of stability for Russia. Whatever the case may be, the result that was ultimately announced by the government is..."
 irkutsk.22.a:0 "Overwhelming dominance by the PDR, with a few friendly independents."
 irkutsk.22.b:0 "A majority for the PDR, but several smaller parties hold a sizable minority of seats."
