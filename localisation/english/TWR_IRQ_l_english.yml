 ## EVENTS ###
 twriraq.0.t:0 "Iraq in 1952"
 twriraq.0.d:0 "Sitting in the ancient region of Mesopotamia, the 'Cradle of Civilisation', Iraq is an Arab Hashemite kingdom, created by the British from the ruins of the defeated Ottoman Empire. Initially ruled directly as a British colony, Britain officially granted Iraq 'independence' in 1932, though retained significant influence in the country as the 1930s saw Europe move towards war. When Britain declared war on Nazi Germany in 1939, dissent began to bubble in the young kingdom, as the Anglo-Axis war seemed to provide the chance for Iraq to free itself from British domination. This was not to be, however, as spectacular defeat of the Anglo-French forces in Europe led to the surrender of France and the Anglo-German Armistice in 1940. Groups, such as the Golden Square, that had been plotting a revolt, now found themselves vulnerable, and a British crackdown combined with concessions to the Iraqi population designed to prevent a revolution drove the group underground, at least for the time being.\n\nHowever, one revolt prevented does not save a waning Empire. The weakness of Britain was shown for all the world to see with its humiliating deescalation with Germany, and the illusion of an invincible power was broken. India broke free, and in Iraq again, for the last decade, dissent has again bubbled up, checked, for now, by the Kingdom and its British protectors.\n\nRevolutionary forces, with much to divide them but united in opposition to the young King Faisal II and his Anglo-American 'overlords', swirl beneath the surface, some of them inspired by the extraordinary success of the European fascist movements, others following different paths. An aggressively expansionist Syria, backed by the new European Order, also may threaten the very existence of the Iraqi state.\n\nNobody knows what the future will bring for Iraq and whether the not yet adult king will survive, but many question whether the old guarantour of the Middle Eastern order in London now has the strength to maintain the status quo. Some radical solutions are being floated, including strengthening the country by working with its Hashemite partners. What's almost certain is that there will be much change in the region in the near future, and Iraq risks getting caught in the sandstorm."
 twriraq.0.a:0 "An interesting time for Iraq"
 # diplomacy
 twriraq.1.t:0 "Federation with Jordan?"
 twriraq.1.d:0 "With the looming Syrian threat, and the expansion of new powers and ideologies into the Middle East, the future security of the Kingdom of Iraq seems under threat. Our allies in Jordan, similarly ruled by a Hashemite monarchy, are in a similar position. As a result, and due to the growing movement of Pan-Arab Nationalism, many have in the last few years proposed a Union between our two nations.\n\nUnder the proposal, Iraq and Jordan would unite into a loose confederation, the United Arab Kingdoms. Both states would mostly continue to rule themselves, but in foreign policy, we would be united.\n\nShould we go ahead with this proposal, the King of Jordan would have to accept as well, who we have been negotiating with for some time. Shall we send the proposal officially."
 twriraq.1.a:0 "Send it"
 twriraq.1.b:0 "We're better off alone"
 twriraq.2.t:0 "Federation with Iraq?"
 twriraq.2.d:0 "An interesting proposal has arrived at the court of our King - a Union with the Kingdom of Iraq. Iraq, ruled by another Hashemite monarchy like ours, is proposing that, in the face of new threats, from Syria and other powers within the region as well as foreign powers without, we must Unite our two kingdoms under one loose Federation.\n\nWhile this would be advantageous for our nation's security, we would be absorbed by a much larger Iraqi nation. Shall we accept?"
 twriraq.2.a:0 "Our people shall be united!"
 twriraq.2.b:0 "We're better off alone"
 twriraq.3.t:0 "Jordan Accepts"
 twriraq.3.d:0 "The King of Jordan has accepted our proposal. Our two nations shall be united into the United Arab Kingdoms!"
 twriraq.3.a:0 "Excellent!"
 twriraq.4.t:0 "Jordan Refuses"
 twriraq.4.d:0 "The King of Jordan has refused our proposal, stating the independence of his nation is paramount."
 twriraq.4.a:0 "What a shame"

 # political
 twriraq.5.t:0 "Civil Unrest"
 twriraq.5.d:0 "Forces hostile to the Kingdom and its percieved western backers have existed and grown strong in Iraq ever since the nation gained independence. Now, however, that opposition is beginning to boil over into unrest. Parties and opposition groups recruit in the shadows, as manifestos and dissenting voices are heard in the streets. Ideas of rebellion are spreading among much of the population."
 twriraq.5.a:0 "Worrying"
 twriraq.6.t:0 "Revolution"
 twriraq.6.d:0 "Tensions have boiled over, and opposition groups have decided that public opposition towards the monarchy has reached a level high enough for a coup to be attempted. Already, a cabal of army officers are planning to take over the government in Baghdad, sensing mass discontent at the rule of the monarchy and their chance to change the country in the way they see fit."
 twriraq.6.a:0 "The coup is foiled"
 twriraq.6.b:0 "Down with the King!"
 twriraq.6.a1:0 "The coup is foiled"
 twriraq.6.b1:0 "Down with the King!"
 twriraq.7.t:0 "The Golden Square"
 twriraq.7.d:0 "As the chaos of the recent coup and the creation of the young Republic continues, another group lurks in the shadows, about to pounce. Calling themselves the Golden Square, they are a group of pro-Axis officers who plotted to overthrow the government during the Anglo-Axis war but were forced to go back underground after the Anglo-German armistice and the British crackdown. Now, emboldened by the chaos that has hit the country, they see a chance for them to seize power once and for all. Now, they have the chance..."
 twriraq.7.a:0 "Golden Square seizes power"
 twriraq.7.b:0 "They are foiled... again"
 twriraq.8.t:0 "Covert Action in Baghdad"
 twriraq.8.d:0 "Recent events in Baghdad are very worrying. After the recent Republican revolution, a group of explicitly pro-Axis officers calling themselves 'The Golden Square' have seized power in the country. It seems very likely that they will pursue an actively pro-German and Italian foreign policy, putting the Middle East in grave danger.\n\nWhile an invasion at this time may be even more destabilising, the CIA may be able to remove them from power by supporting other groups. While a restoration of the monarchy is virtually impossible with the King having been executed, the Ba'ath party is a powerful and popular faction in the the country, and with our support, could come to power. Left-wing Arab nationalists may not be our most preferably ally, but surely better to have them than those who would work with the fascists?"
 twriraq.8.a:0 "Support a Ba'athist coup"
 twriraq.8.b:0 "It's too risky"
 twriraq.9.t:0 "US-backed coup"
 twriraq.9.d:0 "With the pro-Axis coup in Iraq extremely worrying for western interests, covert American elements are backing the Ba'athists in an attempt to force the Golden Square from power. Such a direct seizure of power so soon after the last coup is risky for the Ba'ath party, and an alliance with the west is not exactly something they would normally accept, but this could be the party's only chance at power."
 twriraq.9.a:0 "Seize power!"
 twriraq.9.b:0 "It's too risky"
 twriraq.10.t:0 "A Secret Police"
 twriraq.10.d:0 "Police and intelligence organisations, as well as relevant parts of the military, have been merged under one National Security Organisation to make sure those who would try to overthrow the Kingdom are stopped. Given wide-reaching powers to keep watch on the population, they will keep the nation stable and under our thumb."
 twriraq.10.a:0 "Excellent"
 twriraq.11.t:0 "Controlling the Press"
 twriraq.11.d:0 "Now that the press is under state control, we will decide what the people hear and see. This will certainly secure our power against possible resistance or radical thought."
 twriraq.11.a:0 "Excellent"
 twriraq.12.t:0 "Elections"
 twriraq.12.d:0 "Across the country, the first nationwide Parliamentary elections are being held since the recent reforms and the new constitution. People are enthusiastically turning out to vote, and for the most part we have allowed them the freedom to do so. There is still a guiding hand, with the more radical parties being sidelined and a 'National Bloc' sponsored by the monarchy and the Kin's advisors ready to win on a moderate conservative, Arab nationalist platform, but something close to real democracy has arrived to Iraq."
 twriraq.12.a:0 "National Bloc Coalition Victory"
 twriraq.13.t:0 "The Road to Reform"
 twriraq.13.d:0 "The authoritarian system with a thin veneer of democracy that has run our country since our independence has failed. Recent events have shown that if the monarchy and the Iraqi Kingdom is to survive, it must reform, making changes, allowing freedoms, and giving concessions to the people. Only in this way can our nation be preserved from radicalism."
 twriraq.13.a:0 "It's time for change"
 twriraq.14.t:0 "A New Constitution"
 twriraq.14.d:0 "The cornerstone of our new wave of reforms must be a shift in the laws by which we govern. By drafting a new consitution, we can guarantee the rights of the people and parliament, while also clarifying the central role of the Monarchy and his advisors as a mediating force within the nation. This will both placate those calling for change, as well as securing the position of our state and the power of those close to the King."
 twriraq.14.a:0 "Update the constitution!"
 twriraq.15.t:0 "The Royal Tour"
 twriraq.15.d:0 "Though he is still virtually a child, King Faisal's ministers have persuaded him to embark on a tour of the kingdom, visiting the people and hopefully winning back their confidence. Recent unrest has clearly shown that many in the country resent the monarchy and its insitutions, which represents a clear threat to the Iraqi state. This cannot be allowed to continue, and every effort must be made to improve the imagine of the monarchy and everything it represents in the eyes of the population."
 twriraq.15.a:0 "To the people!"
 twriraq.16.t:0 "Parliament Desolved"
 twriraq.16.d:0 "With the recent massive instability, the King, on advice of his ministers, has dissolved the Iraqi Parliament for the time being, 'until such a time as when order can be restored'. Members were barred from entering and what democracy there is in the country has been indefinitely suspended."
 twriraq.16.a:0 "We must remove distractions"
 twriraq.17.t:0 "War against Saudi Arabia"
 twriraq.17.d:0 "No single Arab state stands against the unification of the Arab people under one Arab nationalist and socialist flag as Saudi Arabia. Building huge wealth from its vast oil resources, the vast Saudi royal family promotes a backwards monarchist system based on extreme religious fanatacism, while they betray their people by working with foreign imperialist powers.\n\nWhile many in our government believe that this insult of a nation must be smashed immediately through force, others say this is too dangerous and could risk foreign intervention. What shall we do?"
 twriraq.17.a:0 "Attack!"
 twriraq.17.b:0 "Bide our time..."
 twriraq.18.t:0 "Seize Jordan"
 twriraq.18.d:0 "Now that we have overthrown our own Hashemite monarchy, many are pushing for us to destroy the other, in Jordan. Not only will this remove a threat to our new Republic and increase its power, but others say our country is not ready for war. How shall we proceed?"
 twriraq.18.a:0 "Attack!"
 twriraq.18.b:0 "Bide our time..."
 twriraq.19.t:0 "Create the Arab Nation"
 twriraq.19.d:0 "With our armies victorious, we can finally begin the process of uniting the Arab peoples. Now, we can declare the Arab State!"
 twriraq.19.a:0 "Arabs United!"
 twriraq.20.t:0 "Ties with Germany"
 twriraq.20.d:0 "Now that we have established our new government, we must begin the task of ridding ourselves and the Middle East of British and American influence. For this task, our natural allies are those that destroyed the French and beat the British, the victorious Germans. While Germany seems to be dealing with much of its own internal difficulty, we can still nonetheless make diplomatic missions to improve ties with the country, though this may risk the ire of the west. Should we do so?"
 twriraq.20.a:0 "Yes, meet with our German allies"
 twriraq.20.b:0 "It's too risky for now"
 twriraq.21.t:0 "Iraq approaches us"
 twriraq.21.d:0 "The new government of Iraq has begun improving ties with us. This can only be a good thing."
 twriraq.21.a:0 "Excellent"
 twriraq.22.t:0 "Joining Italy?"
 twriraq.22.d:0 "Italy has challenged the British in the Middle East ever since the short European war of 1939-40. Since then, they created the Mediterranean Pact as a new alliance of states around the Mediterranean under their guidance. While some argue Italian imperialists are no better than the British, perhaps we would be advantaged and rewarded by joining their alliance and thus breaking free of Anglo-American influence completely."
 twriraq.22.a:0 "Ask to join"
 twriraq.22.b:0 "European imperialists are all the same"
 twriraq.23.t:0 "Iraq Requests to join Med. Pact"
 twriraq.23.d:0 "The new 'Golden Square' government in Iraq, declaring that it will do anything to rid itself and the Middle East of Anglo-American influence, has approached us by requesting entry into the Mediterranean Pact. This would undoubtably expand our influence in the Middle East, but it could lead to heightened tensions and possible confrontation with the British and their American allies. How shall we respond?"
 twriraq.23.a:0 "Accept them"
 twriraq.23.b:0 "They're not worth the trouble"
 twriraq.24.t:0 "Italy Refuses"
 twriraq.24.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Italians have refused our application to the Mediterranean Pact. It seems we must forge a path alone."
 twriraq.24.a:0 "What a shame"
 twriraq.25.t:0 "Seizing Kuwait"
 twriraq.25.d:0 "The greatest symbol of British oppression in the region is Kuwait. Not only is it a rightful part of the Iraqi nation, but it also represents Britain's base in Mesopotamia, from which their dominance of the region is achieved. If we are to achieve true freedom, many say, Kuwait must be taken by force of arms.\n\nA rapid invasion could certainly succeed in seizing the small colony, but that would at the very least cause significant consequences from the western powers, and could even cause war, a war which we may not have the strength to win. Seizing Kuwait is certainly a gamble, but does the need to do so outweigh the risk?\n\n(In a war, holding Kuwait for 1 year will bring a victory event)"
 twriraq.25.a:0 "To Victory!"
 twriraq.25.b:0 "It's too risky"
 twriraq.26.t:0 "Iraq Seizes Kuwait"
 twriraq.26.d:0 "Shocking news from the Middle East - in our time of weakness, Iraq has seized our territory of Kuwait through force of arms, declaring it an integral part of the Iraqi nation. The coming to power of the pro-axis 'golden square' faction had set off alarm bells almost immediately, and it seems such alarm was right.\n\nWhile many in the government are pushing for a declaration of war to retake Kuwait and overthrow the Iraqi government, others see a risk of escalation that we cannot afford, and suggest TA-wide sanctions are a safer response while also guaranteeing this aggression does not go unpunished. What shall we do?\n\n(In a war, if Iraq is not defeated within 1 year, they will win)"
 twriraq.26.a:0 "Retake Kuwait"
 twriraq.26.b:0 "Use sanctions"
 twriraq.27.t:0 "Western Sanctions"
 twriraq.27.d:0 "Britain and America, it seems, were too weak to go to war over Kuwait, and it seems our rule in the region is now secure. Instead, however, they have placed sanctions on our country, which will impact our economy. A price to be sure, but one that is worth the reward."
 twriraq.27.a:0 "Cowards!"
 # War Events #
 twriraq.28.t:0 "Victory in Iran"
 twriraq.28.d:0 "Our forces have succeeded against the Persians, and now comes our chance to end the war. We can seize the lands across the border, including the Arab-majority and oil-rich region of Khuzestan, which we claimed."
 twriraq.28.a:0 "Send the demands"
 twriraq.29.t:0 "Defeat"
 twriraq.29.d:0 "Our forces have been comprehensively defeated by the Arab invaders. We have been pushed back, and even our capital Tehran has fallen to the attackers. With such a disaster, we have no choice but to accept their peace terms, ceding the border regions in the west of our country including the oil-rich and Arab-majority region of Khuzestan.\n\nFor now, this is a disaster for Iran. We can only hope we can reclaim these lands in the future."
 twriraq.29.a:0 "A bitter peace."
 twriraq.29.b:0 "No peace for the Arabs!"
 twriraq.30.t:0 "Iran Accepts"
 twriraq.30.d:0 "Iran has of course accepted our peace terms, and we have gained the territory we sought"
 twriraq.30.a:0 "Victory!"
 twriraq.31.t:0 "Victory in Kuwait"
 twriraq.31.d:0 "Despite their power, the British have failed to retake Kuwait, and we are now victorious!"
 twriraq.31.a:0 "Victory!"
 twriraq.32.t:0 "Defeat in Kuwait"
 twriraq.32.d:0 "We have failed to retake Kuwait from the Iraqis. We have no choice but to accept this humiliating defeat."
 twriraq.32.a:0 "Terrible..."
 twriraq.33.t:0 "Victory against the Saudis"
 twriraq.33.d:0 "We have won a stunning victory against the reactionary Saudis. Their territory is now under our control!"
 twriraq.33.a:0 "Victory!"
 ###
 twriraq.34.t:0 "Kurds Resist"
 twriraq.34.d:0 "Our policies of suppressing Kurdish culture and freedom in favour of an Arab-centric state has, as expected, created increased resistance and resentment. Protests are being held across the Kurdish regions in the north of the country, and even armed rebellion is breaking out against our forces.\n\nHowever, we must remain steadfast. Only through forcing these policies through and crushing any resistance can we stabilise our country and remove secessionist elements."
 twriraq.34.a:0 "Fight them"

 twriraq.35.t:0 "The Arab State"
 twriraq.35.d:0 "With our seizure of Jordan, we have begun on the road towards Arab unification. No longer are we simply an Iraqi Republic, we will from now on be known as an Arab state!"
 twriraq.35.a:0 "Our people will be united!"


 ## FOCUSES ###
 IRQ_Iraqi_Politics:0 "Iraqi Politics"
 IRQ_Iraqi_Politics_desc:0 "Iraq's political status quo is on the edge of a cliff, inching closer and closer to the edge. Many question the continued existence and legitimacy of the monarchy. Other more extem elements are calling for revolution. Others are calling to reform or strengthen the monarchy while others say we should focus on forwarding the pan-Arab dream of a united Arab world. The future is uncertain, but what is certain is this. Iraq is about to change course, irreversibly."
 IRQ_Dual_State:0 "The Dual State"
 IRQ_Dual_State_desc:0 "We must put aside our inner politics and rivalries to focus on the true aim. Iraq, Syria, Jordan, the Saudis. All were drawn on a map by the British and French imperialists to prevent our destiny. That of a united Arab World. Our western neighbour, Jordan, has extended interest in uniting our two nations, both to gain greater independence from the British and to combat the radical Syrian regime. We should make this union of two Hashemite monarchies a reality."
 IRQ_Kingdom:0 "Maintain the Kingdom"
 IRQ_Kingdom_desc:0 "If the Imperialists in Britain have taught us anything, it's the uniting effect of a monarchy on a population. The Hashemite monarchy is the embodiment of order and tradition within our ancient civilisation. However something will need to change for the monarchy to endure and survive. One thing is certain however, the legacy of Faisal shall live on."
 IRQ_Republic:0 "A Republic"
 IRQ_Republic_desc:0 "A monarchy installed by foreign imperialists is not fit to rule the Iraqi people in this day and age. If the Arab people are to move forward into a new era, they must do so as citizens of a Republic."
 IRQ_Revolution:0 "The Revolution"

 IRQ_Baath:0 "Ba'ath Party"
 IRQ_Baath_desc:0 "The Ba'athist Party is spread all across the Arab world, possibly making it one of the most widespread political movements in the globe. A leading voice against the monarchy, the Ba'athist party is a natural leader for the revolution. It enjoys the support of much of the Iraqi population thanks to its populist, anti-imperialist and nationalist policies."
 IRQ_Golden_Square:0 "The Golden Square"
 IRQ_Golden_Square_desc:0 "The Golden Square is something of an urban myth within Iraq, mostly because no one knows much of what the members actually do or represent. Many see it as a social club for officers of sorts. However the truth is, this \"social club\" is a clique of military officers who admire and aspire to Nazi Germany and the Italian Empire. Now they have amassed enough support within the military to seize control of the government in the midst of the revolution. Iraq, it seems, is following the jackboot of much of Europe..."
 IRQ_Uniting_The_Union:0 "Uniting the Union"
 IRQ_Uniting_The_Union_desc:0 "The negotiations are complete, the signatures set down and the border posts prepared for removal. The first step towards destiny is here, for all Arabs. Our peoples will be united under one banner, and this small step will ripple through history."

 IRQ_Rehabilitate_The_Monarchy_desc:0 "The image of the monarchy is one of the key factors in retaining the Hashemite status quo, but it has seen much better times. We must create a new image for the monarchy, one which allows the people to feel the monarchy is in touch with them and their needs."
 IRQ_Reform:0 "Reform"
 IRQ_Reform_desc:0 "If we are to prevent our people from rising up and dragging us through the streets, the monarchy must reform immediately. The British monarchy has survived by relinquishing much of its powers to a legislative body. We should do the same, for the monarchy to survive."
 IRQ_Reaction:0 "Reaction"
 IRQ_Reaction_desc:0 "If the monarchy and Iraq's pride is to survive we cannot compromise with those calling for 'democracy'. The monarchy is the cornerstone of our nation - the people shall rally to the face of our King! None shall question his authority!"

 IRQ_Nationalise_Oil:0 "Nationalise Our Oil"
 IRQ_Nationalise_Oil_desc:0 "The British Empire and their American allies remain the puppet-masters of Iraq's economy, especially in terms of our oil reserves. It is time to seize control of our oil for Iraq benefit, not for the fat British capitalist in London."

 IRQ_Social_Projects:0 "Social Projects"
 IRQ_Social_Projects_desc:0 "Thanks to neglect from the selfish monarchy and exploitation from the British, Iraq remains a poor nation. A key factor in the Ba'athists widespread popular support during the revolution was our promise to enact sweeping reforms and social projects to help the poorest of Iraq. This we must turn into a reality."
 IRQ_State_Controlled_Economy:0 "State-controlled Economy"
 IRQ_State_Controlled_Economy_desc:0 "Iraq's economy is mostly focused on agricultural goods and oil exports.

 IRQ_Join_Italy:0 "Join Italy?"
 IRQ_Join_Italy_desc:0 "Though Italy's performance in the last conflict was… mediocre to say the least, they remain the most potent threat to the British empire in the Mediterranean.

 IRQ_Challenge_Britain:0 "Challenge the British"
 IRQ_Challenge_Britain_desc:0 "The sun is setting on the British Empire! The British have always had their claws in the middle east, especially Iraq, but now they are growing weak. Enough is enough. The Golden Square shall make the British regret ever stepping foot in our lands."

 IRQ_Promote_Iraq_Unity:0 "Promote Iraqi Unity"
 IRQ_Promote_Iraq_Unity_desc:0 "Since the earliest days of the Ottoman Empire, Iraq has been a difficult region to control.

 IRQ_Secret_Police_desc:0 "The nation needs a watchful eye looking over it. Like a mother with her child, constant observation is necessary. But when the child grows unruly and rebellious, a firm hand is required to bring it back to the fold.\n\nA new secret police organisation will be created to watch over the people."
 IRQ_Control_Press:0 "Control the Press"
 IRQ_Control_Press_desc:0 "The press has become increasingly radical over the years, and more and more critical of our government. These newspapers and reporters must be "convinced" to change their headlines."
 IRQ_Stability_Through_Strength:0 "Stability through Strength"
 IRQ_Stability_Through_Strength_desc:0 "The monarch is the embodiment of a nation, an example for all to follow and respect. With this adoration of the monarchy will come strength, and a strong Iraq will survive and endure into the future."
 IRQ_Royal_Tour:0 "A Royal Tour"
 IRQ_Royal_Tour_desc:0 "As the British royal family has done many times, a royal tour of their empire seems to have been an excellent means of making it seem as though they are in touch with their people. A tour of our own royal family to the farthest reaches of Iraq will allow the people to take a peek into royal life. What we want them to see at least."
 IRQ_Sectarian_Issues:0 "Sectarian Issues"
 IRQ_Sectarian_Issues_desc:0 "Another result of Britain's creation of Iraq is our vast sectarian issues. Our nation is dominated by a Sunni minority, while the Shia majority grows increasingly bitter and hostile. Then there is Iraq's Kurdish population, with some calling for autonomy or even independence. The situation is precarious, something must be done!"
 IRQ_Arab_Kurdish_Partnership:0 "Arab-Kurdish Partnership"
 IRQ_Arab_Kurdish_Partnership_desc:0 "Continuing to antagonize and alienate the Kurds will lead to irreparable damage in our relationship. Perhaps greater autonomy should be granted, as well as certain political and social freedoms, in order to turn the Kurds into loyal citizens."
 IRQ_Healing_Sunni_Shia_Rift:0 "Healing the Sunni-Shia Rift"
 IRQ_Healing_Sunni_Shia_Rift_desc:0 "The Shia majority in Iraq feels it is an oppressed people, for the Sunni minority has disproportionate control of institution of government. Through reconciliation and compromise, the widening rift must be healed."
 IRQ_Suppress_Kurds:0 "Suppress the Kurds"
 IRQ_Suppress_Kurds_desc:0 "The Kurds have continued to destabilise our nation, we must teach them a lesson!"
