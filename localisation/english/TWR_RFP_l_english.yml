 KONSTATIN_RODZAEVSKY_DESC:0 "The Terror of the East, Konstantin Vladimirovich Rodzaevsky, was born on August 11th 1907,to a family of middle class Siberians in the city of Blagoveshchensk. Fleeing from the Soviet Union in 1925, his family moved across the border into the land of Chinese warlords, and settled in Harbin. This flight would have a lasting effect on Rodzeevsky, as he would develop a life-long hatred of socialism and the USSR as a result of his flight. He found himself a member of the Emigre Russian Fascist Party, rising to become the party's secretary by 31, and the leader of the entire Russian fascist movement by 1934. Along with Anastasy Vonsyatsky and Mikhail Matkovsky, Rodzaevsky would spend the 30s and World War Two continuing to grow the RFP.\n\nHowever, when the Union collapsed, Rodzaevsky saw a chance to achieve the RFPs long awaited revolution, so he and his followers crossed into Siberia, intent on establishing a fascist state.  However the Americans beat them too it, setting up a Republican government in Vladivostok under Kerensky. Rodzaevsky and the RFP then began an insurgency in the republic, attempting to expel the Amero-Judaic forces from the area. Rodzaevsky was even supposedly killed in 1949, only narrowing escaping death to continue the insurgency. Following a period of decreased activity, Rodzaevsky resumed the Buryatian insurgency in 1951, rapidly making Buryatia into a war zone again. However since his supposed death, the RFP has been biding its time, waiting to once again truly rise up with all its available might in an attempt to establish their long envisioned Fascist Russian utopia, and Rodzaevsky will lead them to it."

Having forged a new Russia with the party's blood and sweat, the Vozhd has sent out feelers around the world to visit the new Russia being forged with the immortal ideology of fascism.\n\nWith time, perhaps, the world's great movements will come under one grand umbrella in the cause of global fascism."

 ### IDEAS ###
 #############
 RFP_Impotent_Army_idea:0 "Impotent Army"
 RFP_Impotent_Army_idea_desc:0 "The armed wing of the Russian Fascist Party is an evolution of the old Blackshirt organizations that operated in Harbin. As a result, these loosely-disciplined "soldiers" have virtually no combat experience and as such will generally underperform in actual combat."
 RFP_Divided_Party_idea:0 "Divided Party"
 RFP_Divided_Party_idea_desc:0 "The RFP has for many years been divided into two camps: Devoted followers of Vozhd Rodzayevsky and the so-called "Matkovsky Group" lead by the Vozhd's second-in-command Mikhail Matkovsky. Opposed to the blatant Germanophilic rhetoric espoused by Rodzayevsky, Matkovsky has long advocated for a strong pan-Slavic party line rejecting the Vozhd's dreams of a "White International" with Hitler against Western democracy and communism.\n\nAs the bitter rivalry between the two men tears party unity apart at its seams, what little state apparatus exists is unable to function properly."

 RFP_Uprising_The_National_Revolution_Begins:0 "The National Revolution Begins"
 RFP_Uprising_The_National_Revolution_Begins_desc:0 "The time has finally come. After much careful preparation under the noses of the enemy, the forces of the Russian Fascist Party are ready to rise up against Buryatia district and seize control of the region from the authorities taking orders from the American lapdogs in Vladivostok. Our uprising will be swift, Buryatia will be seized, and then our national revolution will be carried onward to all of Russia!"
 RFP_Uprising_Raise_the_Asano_Remnants:0 "Raise the Asano Remnants"
 RFP_Uprising_Raise_the_Asano_Remnants_desc:0 "During the 1940s, White Russians in Manchuria were organised into the Asano Brigade within the Manchukuo Imperial Army, through cooperation between Rodzhaevsky and the Japanese authorities. Though this army and brigade were officially destroyed in the wake of Japan's defeat, many RFP fighters escaped capture and scattered into the Siberian anarchy following the Soviet Union's collapse. These men are now among our best trained and most disciplined, and we must make efforts to reestablish the remnants of the Asano brigade into an elite revolutionary fighting force for the RFP."
 RFP_Uprising_Raise_the_Baikal_Brothers:0 "Raise the Baikal Brothers"
 RFP_Uprising_Raise_the_Baikal_Brothers_desc:0 "The veterans of the Asano brigade will be the vanguard of our army, but they cannot win the war alone. Among the new regiments being formed are the Baikal brothers, a detachment of men trained in the Baikal mountains specialising in mountain warfare. We must finish organising this detachment so it can be fully deployed into battle as soon as possible."
 RFP_Uprising_Secure_Bodaybos_Supply_Depots:0 "Secure Bodaybo's Supply Depots"
 RFP_Uprising_Secure_Bodaybos_Supply_Depots_desc:0 "Bodaybo is but a small town among many in this region of Siberia, but our intelligence indicates that the pro-Republic forces are using it as a supply hub for their forces in the region, making it of great strategic importance. We must make sure to seize this town and its supply dumps intact to reinforce our army's strength and deny that strength to the enemy."
 RFP_Uprising_Gukayevs_Gambit:0 "Gukayev's Gambit"
 RFP_Uprising_Gukayevs_Gambit_desc:0 "General Gukayev, high-ranking commander within our forces, has set out an ambitious plan to defeat the region's Republican army. Utilising careful positioning of our elite forces, and the region's geography to our advantage, Gukayev plans to encircle and destroy the majority of the enemy forces in the area in one fell swoop. We give our full backing to this stroke of military genius, and wish to see it carried out successfully."
 RFP_Uprising_Remember_the_Manchurian_Campaigns:0 "Remember the Manchurian Campaigns"
 RFP_Uprising_Remember_the_Manchurian_Campaigns_desc:0 "During its existence, the Asano brigade took part in numerous raids into Soviet territory, as well as the Battle of Khalkhin Gol in 1938. While these operations were of very mixed success, much has been learned from our battles in Siberia against other Russian armies that can be applied to our national revolution. Veterans of the Manchurian raids will be used as instructors to pass on their lessons to the rest of our army, so that all our forces are well-prepared for combat in this unforgiving region."
 RFP_Uprising_Drive_Them_to_the_Wastes:0 "Drive Them to the Wastes!"
 RFP_Uprising_Drive_Them_to_the_Wastes_desc:0 "All necessary preparations have been completed, and our fighting forces have been organised and reinforced to the point of invincibility. Now nothing stands in our way - the RFP's loyal soldiers will sweep aside all who stand against her and the decadent Republic's armies will be driven into the Siberian wastes where they belong!"
 
 RFP_Rearming_Our_New_Base:0 "Rearming Our New Base"
 RFP_Rearming_Our_New_Base_desc:0 "Now that our party has come out of the underground and toppled the decrepit puppet army of Vladivostok, we must use everything at our disposal to turn the region into the headquarters of our liberation war. Our equipment is little and outdated as of right now, we must scavenge for every gun we can get our hands on. Our soldiers have already started to force citizens to give up what little weaponry they owned, together with what the buryatian army garrisons and police force leftovers. We are starting to form a fighting force. This is not enough, though, if we ever wish to rid Holy Russia of bolsheviks and zionists alike, we must squeeze every one of our resources dry."
 RFP_National_Restructuring_Campaign:0 "National Restructuring Campaign"
 RFP_National_Restructuring_Campaign_desc:0 "The economy shall be reorganized into corporations, syndicates and industrial conglomerates, similar to our national socialist brothers in Germany. We would start this process by nationalizing most means of production; all the factories will then go through a campaign of economic reorganization into corporations managed by syndicates and unions. The party has announced the reform as part of it's campaign against communism and international jewry. Our blackshirts and soldiers have been doing a quick work of the task, occupying businesses and factories. This economic reform will bring an end to undesirables ruling over russian industry and agriculture, and bring an era of work and prosperity for the russian man."
 RFP_Syndicate_Reorganisation:0 "Syndicate Reorganisation"
 RFP_Syndicate_Reorganisation_desc:0 "Syndicates must be re-acommodated to fit our needs. Most syndicates and unions will have their leaders swiftly replaced with party members; we will make no exceptions. Syndicates and party must co-operate in order to unite the economic classes into a program of national development and growth. Through a syntesis of labor and State we aim at rebuilding and reorganizing the russian societal structure. Certain syndicates will be assigned certain sectors of the economy , thus giving then some control over factories and production."
 RFP_Our_Old_Harbin_Connections:0 "Our Old Harbin Connections"
 RFP_Our_Old_Harbin_Connections_desc:0 "When the Kuomintang armies rolled into Manchuria, wiping out every remainder of the Empire of Manchukuo and the Japanese army, they forgot about one essential group, one which will be of great help to our cause. We'll ask for help from our contacts in the old city of Harbin, former headquarters of our Fascist Party. Our monarchist, fascist and ex-collaborator friends, we will ask for whatever money, food or clothes they can lend us. The history of the Russian Fascist Party and the city of Harbin goes way back to 1931, when our leader Konstantin Rodzaevsky became secretary general of the party's central committee. Ever since then, our ties with some of the so-called "white emigrés" have grown to become a relation of friendship. Our victory will come at their hand, and of course, good favours aren't forgotten."
 RFP_End_the_Collective_Farms:0 "End the Collective Farms"
 RFP_End_the_Collective_Farms_desc:0 "The collective farms are the prime example of what bolshevism has done to russian society; how dare those so-called "class-strugglers" stomp on the personal property of russian peasants? We will launch an agricultural reform to hand over those formerly collectivized lands back to the people. No more shall Russian peasants suffer under judeo-communist domination by those who claim to "liberate" them. Our Fascist Part and National State will bring the final liberation to all of Russia."
 RFP_Anti_Materialist_Austerity:0 "Anti-Materialist Austerity"
 RFP_Anti_Materialist_Austerity_desc:0 "One of the ways to put an end to decadence and corruption of society is to promote a simple life, deprived of useless luxuries that only contribute to the degeneration of men. This is sponsored by class-strugglers, jews and republicans, whose wish is to destroy the Russian man, his life, and institutions. Whether they want it or not, they must complain, we can't let precious materials go to waste; we must bleed every single one of them dry, leaving no stone squeezed. The National Revolution will put every single one of our assets on line, we can't waste anything."
 RFP_Mass_Recruitment_Drive:0 "Mass Recruitment Drive"
 RFP_Mass_Recruitment_Drive_desc:0 "As we are getting closer to the start of our National Revolution, we must start to mass conscript men to bolster our numbers. Announcements will be made on radio, posters will be hung all across the country, our commissars will reach out to every city, town and village to take every man they can with them. Most will be driven to the frontiers to follow rapid courses of training; we cannot waste much time on this stage, our soldiers must be ready for combat as fast as possible. Our baptism of fire cannot be our last battle, our army of soldiers and blackshirts will stand firm against the enemy, they shall die for God, Nation and Labour. We have guns, we have clothes, we have industry, we only need men."
 RFP_The_New_White_Terror:0 "The New White Terror"
 RFP_The_New_White_Terror_desc:0 "With bloodthirsty bolsheviks and revengeful zionists ready to strike at our National State, we must make an early assault against the enemies of the Russian people. Our blackshirts have already planned an all-out assault against jewish-owned businesses and households. Bolotov's men are already working on our terror campaign, hundreds of undesirables have been arrested and swiftly dissapeared, never to be heard of again. The Russian Fascist Party will take care of corrupt degenerates in our state, protecting the russian people, their culture, and traditions."
 RFP_Empower_the_Special_Division:0 "Empower The Special Division"
 RFP_Empower_the_Special_Division_desc:0 "Alexander Bolotov and his Special Division are a vital element for the massacre of the undesirables.

 RFP_The_Blackshirt_Commissars:0 "The Blackshirt Commissars"
 RFP_The_Blackshirt_Commissars_desc:0 "We will introduce our fascist blackshirts as commissars into the army; they will keep morale high on our soldiers, as well as looking for any dissent inside of the armed forces. Our commissar patrols shall also act as police service, purging undesirables and criminals from the streets of our cities and towns. This will bring an end to violence and anarchy in our lands. The old blackshirts will act as a perfect propaganda tool, they will shout the Party's dictates through town, encouraging people not to do activities that might be considered "anti-russian". Our russian men and russian arms will expunge degeneracy from our country!"
 RFP_Embrace_Asemitism:0 "Embrace A-Semitism"
 RFP_Embrace_Asemitism_desc:0 "A-semitism is the belief that semitic people, such as jews, should be completely eradicated from society, with them being absent and having no influence on it; this term was coined by Hungarian Ferenc Szálasi. We will wholly implement this idea, a society where enemies of the state will have no power to jeopardize our life and beliefs. We will start by kicking said undesirables out of population centers, then having our activities beginning. This way, we will finally cleanse our National Russia from decadence and corruption."
 RFP_Unleash_the_Saboteurs:0 "Unleash the Saboteurs"
 RFP_Unleash_the_Saboteurs_desc:0 "We will introduce saboteur partisans across the border with the republicans. They will send misinformation, jeopardize military operations, and most important of all, disrupt communication between the military outposts and the central command in Vladivostok. We are already training our best blackshirts for the job, they have gone through days of intense courses to prepare them for what's to come. This is our most important operation prior to our march to the Pacific, we cannot let this fail."
 RFP_Our_March_to_the_Sea:0 "Our March to the Sea"
 RFP_Our_March_to_the_Sea_desc:0 "We're ready, our brave men have awaited this moment for months; those weak-minded Vladivostok republicans will finally get what they deserve for undermining the will of our Party.

 RFP_Proclaim_the_All-Russian_National_Government:0 "Proclaim the All-Russian National Government"
 RFP_Proclaim_the_All-Russian_National_Government_desc:0 "We did it! Brave Russian men have defeated those scum, establishing control over all of the Russian Far East. The Russian Fascist Party is now in a position where we can proclaim ourselves as the true government of all Russias. This way, no one is going to consider us a team of "extremist bandits" anymore, our enemies will have to think seriously about us from now on. Vozhd Rodzaevsky will deliver a speech to all the russian men and women of the Far East, this speech will also be broadcasted in Radio all through the region."
 RFP_Rein_in_the_Industrialists:0 "Rein in the Industrialists"
 RFP_Rein_in_the_Industrialists_desc:0 "A lot of businessmen were left worried after the defeat of the Republic that they're enterprises might be seized by our government. This is not the case, we're not like bolsheviks or the petty warlords that came before the Republic's establishment. We shall make deals with this class of industrial businessmen, securing their support and trust. These assets will be left under private hands, with some control from our syndicates to assure the Russian worker is being protected."
 RFP_Corporatist_Shock_Therapy:0 "Corporatist Shock Therapy"
 RFP_Corporatist_Shock_Therapy_desc:0 "Shock therapy is a way of introducing a radically different production system into an economy. In this case, we shall make a quick and fast introduction of the corporatist economic system into the Russian economy.

 RFP_Reintroduce_the_Curfew_desc:0 "As we expected, our arrival to Vladivostok, Magadan, Yakutsk and other cities of the former republic wasn't met with positive reactions,the opposite has happened.

 RFP_The_Fourth_Branch_of_the_Military_desc:0 "The old blackshirts have been there for the Russian Fascist Party since the very beginning. Throughout these years, they have proven to be an excellent paramilitary organization, fighting countless battles against our enemies, both in Manchuria and in Buryatia.

 RFP_Our_Scapegoat_desc:0 "Those undesirables are the reason for the defeats and hardships of our Russian nation! First in 1917, with the bolsheviks claiming to "liberate" the people, they shed more Russian blood than any enemy ever could. Then in 1945, when those bastards Stalin, Kalinin and Beria gave the nation it's greatest loss. Now, though, it's time for us to take our revenge, those filthy enemies of the National State will never be able to attempt another blow on us.

 RFP_Convene_the_All_Russian_Supreme_Soviet_desc:0 "We will call the state and party to unite this time to address an internal issue. Ever since the resurgence of the party in the region of Buryatia. There was a crack inside of the Russian fascist party, with the supporters of Vozhd Rodzaevsky, long advocator of national socialism and collaboration with the Reich on one side, and those who favour Mikhail Matkovsky, strong anti-german and slavophile, on the other.

 RFP_Introduce_Anti_Germanism_desc:0 "The Russian people owe it's latest hardships to Germany, this is undeniable. The germans have caused our holy Russia to fall to the bolsheviks back in 1917; then they topped it off when Hitler's brutalized hordes defeated the armies of Stalin and Kalinin. We will introduce anti-germanism into the party and the citizenry, we'll shower them with propaganda against the german menace.

 rfp.1.a:0 "The first step."
 rfp.2.t:0 "The National Restructuring Campaign"
 rfp.2.d:0 "The incompetents who ran Buryatia before us have left the wonderous state in complete disarray. It is now up to us and only us to restructure Buryatia in the glorious image of the Vozhd's Fascist ideals!"
 rfp.2.a:0 "Buryatia sshall become a model fascist state!"
 rfp.3.t:0 "A Precarious Package"
 rfp.3.d:0 ""So these are...food supplies, right?" The Chinese border guard asked suspiciously. It was painfully clear that the "food truck" was really just a cover for an arms shipment. \n\n"Yes, the Vozhd of Buryatia ordered us to bring food to the needy of Chita." The truck driver replied. Nikolai was extremely nervous about the whole ordeal, it being his first time smuggling guns from China. "Look i'm sure the Vozhd means well but i just need to make sure you aren't carrying any contraband, just open one and we can all be done." The border guard persisted, peeking into the truck at the conspicuous crates labelled as food. "LOOK i'm in a really tight schedule here officer, why don't you just take a little something for some cross-border beer and we can have some drinks." Nikolai blurted out nervously, shuffling through his pockets to get out 400 Yuan. The border guard was not used to taking bribes, however his higher-ups had cut his pay recently. "Alright sir, my shift ends at Seven O'Clock. We meet back here then?" the officer said, taking Nikolai's money. "It's a deal." Nikolai replied, loosening up. \n\nGetting back into his truck, Nikolai was proud of finally completing a gun run for the RFP. Perhaps that Chinese officer would make for a good drinking friend as well, he lamented. "
 rfp.3.a:0 "Unlikely friends in a strange world."
 rfp.4.t:0 "Flushing Out Stragglers"
 rfp.4.d:0 "One of the Vozhd's first directives on seizing power in the reaches of Buryatia has been the consolidation of his new power base. As heavy resistance to the RFP's rule continues throughout the major towns and countryside, we will need to institute the most punitive anti-partisan measures in the interest of order in the wastes. "
 rfp.4.a:0 "Bringing order to Russia one bullet at a time."
 rfp.5.t:0 "Inspiration"
 rfp.5.d:0 ""There seem to be movements all across Europe with the same conclusion as ours!" Rodzayevsky said delightedly, reading a newspaper about ongoing events in Hungary. Alexander Bolotov was in the room with the Vozhd, keenly listening to his leader fawning over a movement he had only just learned about "It says right here that members of the so-called 'Arrow Cross' movement have embraced such a virulent hatred of Jewry that they'll completely eliminate Hungary's entire Jewish race!" Bolotov glanced into his half-empty glass of vodka and looked back at Konstantin "And we could apply this principle all the way out here?" He asked with a slight grin on his face. Rodzayevsky leaned forward and put a pistol on his desk "I not only want you to apply this 'A-Semitism' here, i want you to PERFECT IT." He said sternly. Bolotov picked up the pistol and examined it thoroughly, tonight was a good night as any to get started he thought to himself. Leaving the Vozhd's office, he wasted no time in issue his next instructions to the Special Department."
 rfp.5.a:0 "Russia's soul shall be cleansed."
 rfp.6.t:0 "A Shooting At The Vladivostok Circus!"
 rfp.6.d:0 "Tragedy has struck the Vladivostok Circus this evening as a group of gunmen opened fire on the crowd killing 29 and taking hundreds hostage. After a tense standoff with local police lasting through the night, the circus was eventually stormed by officers killing all five gunmen without much difficulty. Our security agency later found out that these men were working in a clandestine operation funded by the Russian Fascist Party. Having recently carved out a chunk of our land for their twisted selves, it would appear that Rodzayevsky's men have become more daring in their attempts at usurping our government. As the criminal investigation continues in this attack, one question looms above everyone's heads; If the blackshirts can strike in Russia's heartland, what's stopping them from marching into the rest of free Russia?"
 rfp.6.a:0 "A disturbing turn of events."
 rfp.7.t:0 "Saboteurs In The Hills"
 rfp.7.d:0 "As our forces in the far eastern reaches of Russia prepare for what many fear will be a direct confrontation with the rebellion in Buryatia, groups of blackshirt saboteurs have been operating behind our supply lines attempting to hamper our efforts against their so=called "National Revolution." "
 rfp.7.a:0 "We will deal with them too."
 rfp.8.t:0 "The Swastika On High"
 rfp.8.d:0 "Having defeated the degenerate International Jewish-controlled Russian Republic, Konstantin Rodzayevsky paraded himself through the streets of Vladivostok to silent crowds of hungry and bewildered people. Later going on the radio, the Vozhd has announced that the first stage of the National Revolution has finally been completed. Calling the new All-Russian National State the true successor of the Russian Empire, Rodzayevsky presented an ultimatum to all the Russian splinter states and the "Judeo-Bolshevik" Toronto Accord that their time on Earth is now fleeting."
 rfp.8.a:0 "Slava Vozhdyu!"
 rfp.9.t:0 "The Vladivostok Pogrom"
 rfp.9.d:0 "It is no secret that anti-semitism is a core component of the ideology of the Russian Fascist Party. With much of the party's rhetoric openly stating their disdain for the Jewish people, the RFP has done everything short of openly calling for the expulsion or murder of all Jews within Russian territory, at least until today. With the Russian National Republic now in control of the entirety of the Russian Far East, Vozhd Rodzaevesky has begun to implement his vision for the ideal Russian society, starting with what is seen as the simplest yet most pressing issue to resolve.\n\nThis came to fruition on the orders of the Vozhd a few days ago, when he directed the army to begin the systematic destruction of Jewish life and culture within Vladivostok, proclaiming that they should be eliminated immediately given their existence as an imminent threat to national security. Following these orders, the army enacted a pogrom across the city, violently evicting Jewish neighborhoods, looting Jewish businesses and synagogues before setting fire to them, raping Jewish women who hadn't already been murdered, and deporting the surviving Jews out of the city to be killed and buried in mass graves or be sailed out to sea and drowned. While Jews were the primary target of the pogrom, several other minorities were arbitrarily targeted by soldiers out of natural prejudice, including Chinese, Korean, Uzbek, and Ukrainian inhabitants of the city, though incidents of violence against them was significantly lower than that against Jews.\n\nThe pogrom ended three days after it had begun, with over 10,000 Jews estimated to have been killed in the event, with the remaining members of the Jewish community were spurred into fleeing the city for China and Korea to avoid further reprisals en masse, and as news of the pogrom spreads throughout our territory, the trend is likely to continue. Overall, it appears that the pogrom has successfully eliminated Jewry from Vladivostok through a combination of direct intervention and fear tactics, although it remains to be seen if such success can be replicated further with the larger Jewish populations westwards."
 rfp.9.a:0 "A great day for Vladivostok and Russia!"
 rfp.10.t:0 "Reintegrating Monarchist Generals"
 rfp.10.d:0 "Now that the Russian Fascist Party has firmly established itself as a polity among the various post-war statelets, we now stand in the greatest position we have ever found ourselves in to bring fascism to the entirety of Russia. However, that position in itself still leaves much to be desired. One of our most glaring shortcomings would be our officer corps, which primarily consists of Japanese trained former members of the Asano Brigade within the Manchukuo Imperial Army, with limited numbers and experience to run a large military tasked with reconquering the remains of Russia. To that end, we have recently made a breakthrough regarding the issue, that being in the reintegration of former Monarchist generals who served during the Civil War.\n\nDespite the RFP having no intentions to restore the Romanovs, these generals appear to be motivated by our opposition to the liberal republic and the communists to the west, thereby finding common ground with us to stand on and have offered their services to the Russian National State. With the general's reintegration currently underway, we now hope to have heightened capabilities in managing a large military and training the next generation of officers to take their place once they have passed away."
 rfp.10.a:0 "The vanguard of the Russian people grows stronger yet!"
 rfp.11.t:0 "The All-Russian Supreme Soviet's First Congress"
 rfp.11.d:0 "The victory was ours at the end of the day! Absolute control is established, but after our glorious revolution, we must mend the divisions within the party. The so-called "Matkovsky Group" threatens the very fabric of our beloved party, and it must be brought to heel! As the delegates enter the ruins of the Vladivostok Duma, one thing is for certain: The future of the Russian Fascist Party and perhaps, Russia itself, is at stake."
 rfp.11.a:0 "Factionalism must end at all costs!"
 rfp.12.t:0 "The Jewish Problem"
 rfp.12.d:0 "One of the biggest points of contention within the party, the question of what to do with Russia's Jews has made party delegates supporting Rodzayevsky and Matkovsky to nearly trade blows. The Rodzayevskyist line demands the continuation of the Vozhd's "A-Semitic" policy of making Russia completely inhospitable for its "Zionist saboteurs", while the Matkovskyists call for moderation on this policy in the hopes of using Russian Jews as labourers for the Russian race."
 rfp.12.a:0 "Moderation on the "Jewish Problem" will win us legitimacy going forward."
 rfp.12.b:0 "The Jews are traitors to the Russian people and will be treated as such!"
 rfp.13.t:0 "On The Germans"
 rfp.13.d:0 "The history of our party is closely connected with the goals set by Nazi Germany. Everything she has done so far has benefited us because she has wiped out her biggest internal problem - Judeo-Bolshevik capitalism and communism. But some idiots within our ranks, as always, must be divided into two camps because, as it seems, their main goal is to divide our party. The faction led by Leader Rodzaevesky believes that the most ideal approach to the "German question" is to approach them in case we need help or to accept them on an international issue. The group led by Matkovsky advocates a general rejection of German rhetoric. The congress did not last long and the issue was resolved in just one hour where it was concluded:"
 rfp.13.a:0 "The Hun are the enemy of all Russians."
 rfp.13.b:0 "Actually, the Germans are our brothers."
 rfp.14.t:0 "The Question Of Splitters"
 rfp.14.d:0 "While traitors remain traitors to their homeland, individuals within our Party think that it is a smart idea to cooperate with those who decided to betray us, to leave us, to fuck us in the worst hours. Now that we are on the verge of victory, they have found a mole in the opposition ranks and are trying to seize all the possible power they can find. The faction led by Matkovsky advocates the idea of bringing Anastasy Vonsiatsky back to our state, our government, while the faction led by Chief Rodzaevesky advocates the idea of not keeping Vonsiatsky under our roof, no matter how useful he may have been given that he decided to leave our Party at the most vicious and darkest hour. Nevertheless, the vote was conducted and the result was:"
 rfp.14.a:0 "Vonsiatsky will give us all the help we need."
 rfp.14.b:0 "Traitors like Vonsiatsky belong in the dustbin of history!"
 rfp.15.t:0 "Matkovsky Victorious"
 rfp.15.d:0 "With the formal conclusion of the 1st Congress of the Russian Fascist Party, it appears that Vozhd Rodzaevesky's gambit to increase his hold over the party has backfired, with the Congress adopting numerous resolutions in favor of the Matkovskyist faction of the party. Although the Congress serves little function outside of approving party ideology and direction, the mere adoption of Matkovskyist ideals into these represent a grave weakness for the Vozhd through his inability to control the party to his whims, with vast swathes of it now showing that they adhere primarily to Mikhail Matkovsky.\n\nAlthough the press is still presenting the Congress as a major accomplishment of unity and perseverance for the party and the Russian people, this obscures the far more fragmented and chaotic truth within the party's upper echelons. The outcome of the Congress has left Vozhd Rodzaevesky scrambling to consolidate his remaining allies in a last-minute bid to maintain his hold over the party, while Matkovsky has conversely been trying to make inroads with these very allies to further his influence within it. If anything, the Congress has merely further deepened the divisions within the Russian Fascist Party, and it appears that Rodzaevesky day's as Vozhd are numbered."
 rfp.15.a:0 "How long until we're saluting Vozhd Matkovsky?"
 rfp.16.t:0 "Rodzayevsky Victorious"
 rfp.16.d:0 "With the formal conclusion of the 1st Congress of the Russian Fascist Party, it appears that Vozhd Rodzaevesky's gambit to increase his hold over the party has succeeded, with the Congress adopting numerous resolutions reinforcing the orthodox Rodzaeveskyite faction of the party. Although the Congress itself serves little function outside of approving party ideology and direction (with the resolutions in question not even effecting party policy), the Congress has affirmed Rodzaevesky's control over the party and halted the growth of the Matkovskites in its tracks.\n\nAs for the Matkovskities themselves, although the Congress has effectively prevented them from taking over anytime soon, they still hope to maintain a presence within the party to eventually rebuild their movement back into a position to take control. This itself, however, has been characterized as essentially romantic, as it is an open secret within the party ranks that the Vozhd will use the political momentum gained from the Congress to launch an internal purge when given the eventual opportunity. As such, the main priority of the Matkovskities as of now has been a desperate scramble to secure allies in high-ranking positions to stave off, or at least minimize, a potential purge."
 rfp.16.a:0 "The noose tightens..."
 rfp.17.t:0 "Bolotov Kidnapped!"
 rfp.17.d:0 "Alexander Bolotov, a high-ranking member of the Russian Fascist Party responsible for managing much of the state's internal security apparatus, has recently disappeared without a trace. The last reported sighting of Bolotov was following a routine meeting with Rodzaevesky three days ago, in which he was seen entering his private transport to presumably head back to his residence. Nothing was seen as being out of the ordinary as it was first assumed that Bolotov had merely been taking a short holiday by permission of the Vozhd, and it was only when the Vozhd noticed Bolotov's absence that he sent a group of blackshirts to retrieve him from his household. Upon arrival, the building was empty, with no signs of the occupants anywhere, but with enough evidence for a likely kidnapping.\n\nGiven Bolotov's close association with the Vozhd, Rodzaevesky has privately placed the blame on the Matkovskyists for the kidnapping, although with the lack of evidence to any party, no actual arrests can be made without being based on hearsay. Still, the Markovskyists are the most likely party involved, with the only plausible candidates being some ambitious bandits or left-wing stragglers. Regardless, a formal, high-priority investigation has been launched into the matter, and any updates regarding it will be forwarded to the Vozhd as they occur."
 rfp.17.a:0 "Hopefully this will be a cassus belli to get rid of Matkovsky once and for all."
 rfp.18.t:0 "Bolotov Presumed Dead!"
 rfp.18.d:0 "After only a few weeks since the investigation into the disappearance of Alexander Bolotov was launched, it has subsequently gone cold. With barely any leads or evidence to go off of, investigators were forced to look into the history behind the driver of Bolotov's escort, which in turn proved fruitless as the driver was discovered to have not been with Bolotov at the time, with an alibi to prove it. As such, the current working theory is that Bolotov was kidnapped through a man posing as his driver, who then brought him to an undisclosed location. Who the perpetrators were, or what they were planning to do with the man, is still officially unknown, but given the evidence on hand, investigators feel it is safe to assume that Mr. Bolotov is dead.\n\nRegardless of their guilt or blame in the incident, the Matkovskyists will undoubtedly benefit in their expansion of influence from the absence of one of the Vozhd's most ardent supporters. The Vozhd himself is considerably upset at the recent developments and is determined to keep the case file open so that Bolotov's murderers can be brought to justice, although, given the lack of leads, the case has been lowered in priority, de facto ending the investigation."
 rfp.18.a:0 "The perfect crime."
 rfp.19.t:0 "The Anti-Rodzaevesky Coup"
 rfp.19.d:0 "Ever since the conclusion of the 1st Congress of the Russian Fascist Party, it has been seldom known that the Matkovskyist faction has become the dominant force within the Russian Fascist Party. Despite Vozhd Rodzaevesky's disdain for the faction, he has found himself outmaneuvered by the bloc politically and has been scrambling to consolidate his allies in a last-ditch effort to regain control over the deeply divided party.\n\nToday, those efforts have been shown to be in vain, as Blackshirt militias began to erratically deploy along the outskirts of Vladivostok, securing essential transportation and communication links while doing so. After orders to demobilize went unheeded, it was clear that a Matkovskyist coup was underway to remove Rodzaevesky, beginning a mad dash among loyalist units to put down the revolt. For the next five hours, Vladivostok became a warzone as Blackshirts clashed over the major streets and strategic locations around the city, but by the end of it all, it was clear that the Matkovskyists had the clear strategic advantage over the loyalists, with them beginning to close in on various government buildings.\n\nWhat followed was a citywide search for any and all high-ranking Rodzaeveskites found within the city, with government officials and officers being shot on-site without any hesitation, while the remaining loyalists were detained for disarmament and reeducation. As for Rodzaevesky himself, he was found embedded within a small detachment of Blackshirts alongside several members of the general staff at the port attempting to escape aboard a commandeered civilian vessel. Although they managed to set sail, it was reported they took heavy losses in the process, with the former Vozhd himself having been shot in the upper abdomen on the way, with several of his more devoted followers carrying him on board, where he presumably died due to a lack of adequate medical treatment.\n\nRegardless, once the city was firmly under Matkovskyist control, Mikhali Matkovsky himself took to the radio to address the broader citizenry about the recent events. In it, he exposed a supposed plot by Rodzaevesky to purge the majority Matkovskyist faction from the party, contrary to the will of the Russian people as expressed within the recent RFP Congress. As such, Matkovsky took preemptive action by ousting Rodzaevesky from power to secure the future of Russian from the hands of the “Germanophiles and collaborators.” Furthermore, Makovsky also proclaimed himself as the new Vozhd of Russia, pledging to reunify the country and return it to its former status as a great power for the prosperity of the Russian people."
 rfp.19.a:0 "A new face for Russian fascism."
 rfp.20.t:0 "New Patriarch Instated"
 rfp.20.d:0 "The Russian Orthodox Church, a cornerstone of the lives of Russians around the world, has been in a state of limbo since 1927 when the treacherous deputy patriarchal locum tenens Sergius issued a declaration of subservience to the Soviet Union. This granted him powers he was not entitled to have according to XXXIV Apostolic Canon, forcing many Russian Orthodox Churches Abroad to break communion with the Sergiainist Church, but with no clear successor to the office of the Patriarchy, millions of Russians were left without a spiritual light to guide them through the turbulence that laid ahead. That changes today, as a local council sponsored by the Russian Fascist Party consisting of prominent members of the Russian Orthodox Church has now elected Valentin Antonyev as the new Patriarch of Moscow and all the Rus.\n\nHaving previously worked as a Bishop in the Russian emigre community in Brisbane, Australia, Antonyev has been known for his alleged support of the fascist ideas of Hitler and Rodzaevesky. However, he denies having ever condoned or condemned the ideology, explaining his nationalism as a simple consequence for being the spiritual leader of the Russian people. However, Antonyev’s election has been doubtlessly influenced by the RFP, given that their open endorsement, as well as their sponsorship of the local council, makes him at the very least a figurehead that won’t challenge the regime’s authority. Though this local council has yet to be recognized by the rest of the Church within Russia, this should only be a temporary problem, as once the nation is under our control, the remaining Sergianists will doubtlessly fall in line. That being said, the majority of Russian Orthodox Churches outside of Russia have recognized the council’s legitimacy, with many restoring communion with the reestablished church in the motherland, helping to heal the schism torn open by the USSR."
 rfp.20.a:0 "Holy Russia, reborn."
 rfp.21.t:0 "Three Days of Terror"
 rfp.21.d:0 "With his position as the leader of the RFP secured following the First Congress of the Russian Fascist Party, Vozhd Rodzaevesky has now turned his attention towards fully molding the party towards his ideals, with his primary target now being his weakened adversaries in the Matkovskyist faction. As the Vozhd felt an imprudent need to rid the party of the faction, he ordered a complete and utter purge of the group's members from the party ranks in a matter that would be both brutal and discreet.\n\nThe past three days have been the culmination of those efforts, as undercover Blackshirts have raided the residences of prominent Matkovskyist party members, arresting them alongside their families, as well as a number of their contacts and close associates to minimize the number of witnesses. Detaining them in numerous ad hoc black sites outside of Vladivostok, they were injected with lethal amounts of morphine to maintain plausible deniability, with their bodies being buried in mass graves outside the black sites. Matkovsky himself was given a unique fate as he was presented with the dignity of taking his own life by hanging himself rather than the Blackshirts doing it themselves; however, he, unfortunately, refused the opportunity.\n\nThe purge so far has been a resounding political success for the Vozhd, with the party now being stacked with loyalists throughout the party ranks, leaving him unchecked in his aspirations for Russian reunification. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the state's capacity for said reunification, as the purge swept up a number of the military's high ranking officers, most being members of the esteemed Asano Brigade, and it will take a considerable amount of time for the gaps in the command structure to be refilled with competent officers. Regarding the public's knowledge, we have taken advantage of the average citizen's ignorance of the political situation within the party and have made a sort of “less is more” approach, with official party outlets not mentioning the purge or the officials removed for the foreseeable future."

"It is time we Russians redeem ourselves before God!" The patriarch shouted through a microphone in front of a massive audience.\n\n"The jews have abandoned God and sold their souls to Satan; even then, these sodomite people have the audacity to occupy Jerusalem, Tiberius, Hebron, and countless cities of the Holy Land.." Patriarch Antoniyeff turned around the paper of his speech, the crowd observing remained static "International Zionism has crawled its way into several nations of the world; the American president, the British Prime minister, among others..."\n\nTo the side of the Patriarch sat a crew of radio operators, the Father's sermon was to be heard all-across Holy Russia "..Even in our Holy Russian land, the judeo-bolsheviks have corrupted millions of christian Russians beyond salvation, turning them into slaves, nothing but deranged soldiers of Zion(...)Marx, Lenin, Stalin, Beria, all of these monsters were servants of the international jewish ploy against Russia. As proud believers, we must put an end to the oppression of Christians by these zionist "class-strugglers", I call to our nation, a crusade!

If we are to restore the moral strength of Russia, these traitorous forces must be dealt with quickly. Just as Hitler eliminated threats to his German revival through the Night of the Long Knives, a quick and brutal planned period of righteous violence against those we have found to be spreading atheism will be enacted.

Upon further questioning, he revealed that the purpose of said killings was to bleed the females dry and to utilize their blood for zionists rits" This could already raise some alarms among the local populace of Vladivostok, yet the headline article continued, reading:\n\n"His last confession before trial also reveals that he isn't acting on his own, a brutal gang of jewish murderers is currently running free through the streets of Vladivostok" The tabloid ended with a message to the people of the port city: "Citizens of Vladivostok, it is urgent you report any suspicious activity you may encounter in your area to a local police station, this killer gang is working along with an underground zionist network in the city"\n\nThus the article ended, in the following weeks, massive reportings of jewish activities ensued, with hundreds of enemies of the state being detained."

In a policy and process reminiscent of the Volksgemeinschaft in Germany, all the Russian people under the leadership of our Party are dedicating themselves to a singular cause, the only cause, the matters, the cause of the nation.

To emphasise this message and make sure our Party's influence is felt in all parts of the population, the Russian Fascist Party will for the first time welcome women into its ranks as representatives of ideal womanhood. The natural role of women within Russian society, as loyal wives and good mothers to the next generation, will be emphasised. To aid women in this task, a national Fertility Institute will be created to promote larger families and the raising of more children, to ensure that the demographically damaged Russian nation can proliferate once again."

 rfp.27.d:0 "Ever since Vonsiatsky's Russian Fascist Organization attempted to join with the RFP in 1931, he and Rodzaevsky almost immediately clashed over multiple issues of party policy, for example the position towards the Jews. These divisions nearly broke the party apart in its infancy, and robbed us of Vonsiatsky's vast wealth and passion. As we have deposed the backwards line of the Rodzaeveskites, we can finally get back to undoing one of our greatest mistakes dating back to our days as a clandestine Harbin fraternity.\n\nIn a grand ceremony in Vladivostok today, we have welcomed Vonsiatsky back into Russia and the party, shorly after his old travel ban was revoked. Promising to work hard with Vozhd Matkovsky to bring about a national rejuvenation of a unified Russia, Vonsiatsky's return also marks a rebranding of the party; The All-Russian Fascist Front.\n\nCoined by the Vonsiatskyist/Matkovskite union, the new party is a radical shift towards uniting the radical anticommunist movements of Russia under an umbrella front to end the Bolshevik pretenders and revive the glory of pre-revolutionary Russia."
 rfp.27.a:0 "Come one and all!"
 rfp.28.t:0 "Report On The Moral Fabric Of Russia"
 rfp.28.d:0 "A report into the moral realities of contemporary Russian society commissioned by the RFP has left Mikhail Matkovsky disappointed at the state of affairs. Decades of communist rule, it seems, has left the once holy and idyllic Russian civilisation a degenerate mess. Decadent ideals of socialism or liberalism have penetrated much of the Russian population, leading to mass disobedience and civil strife. Even worse, the basic morals of individuals have been degraded. Vices such as gambling are now common, and the consumption of intoxicating drugs has exploded due to lack of enforcement.\n\nClearly, there is much to be done if the Russian nation is to recover from this disaster and be rejuvenated. This moral degeneration must be purged from society by all members of the RFP with the utmost strength and brutality - only then can Russia truly be saved."
 rfp.28.a:0 "We have much work to do."
 rfp.29.t:0 "Raiding Vladivostok's Criminal Underground"
 rfp.29.d:0 "Among the many moral vices that have plagued eastern Russia under the socialist and liberal regimes, the use of intoxicating drugs is one of the greatest. Fuelling corruption, crime and social disturbance, the proliferation of an underground drug market in Vladivostok had allowed moral corruption to spread across the entire city.\n\nMatkovsky had been determined to put a stop to this, and decided that only the harshest of measures could stamp out this cancer. Armed fascist militias were let loose on society, ordered to end drug use and organised crime by any means necessary.\n\nIn truth, they may have gone a little overboard - there are reports of outbreaks of mass violence and the arrests, assaults and even killing of those suspected of drug trafficking or use, and within weeks Matkovsky was forced to reign in the enforcers. Undoubtedly many innocents had been caught in the crossfire. However, drug use and trade certainly seems to be down, and despite the blood spilled, the policy seems to have been a success, at least for now. A tight leash will be kept on society to prevent such moral corruption spreading again."
 rfp.29.a:0 "Some sacrifices have to be made."
 rfp.30.t:0 "Days of Rage"
 rfp.30.d:0 "With Central Russia now under the control of the Russian Fascist Party, the time had finally come to rid Russia of the last remnants of the communist 'disease'. With the backing of the party leadership, a violent purge was authorised across the newly retaken territories to stamp out any remaining pockets of socialist ideology.\n\nIn scenes reminiscent of the Red Terror, but the roles very much reversed, the Blackshirts were unleashed on newly conquered Russian cities. Known political elites and activists were the first to go, arrested and shot on site. From there, the violence broadened against anyone suspected of communist or anti-fascist thought. Denunciations were incentivised, those denounced dragged through sham trials and killed or sent to Stalin’s old camps. Normalisation of violence and ideological fervor led to escalating and increasingly arbitrary violence, and a chaotic breakdown in society as even the slightest deviation from RFP orthodoxy saw people rapidly disappearing from society, or even executed in public.\n\nBy the time the party leadership had reeled in the Blackshirts, the job was done. Russia, at least the parts under RFP control, has once again been restabilised through brutality and force by a new radical regime."
 rfp.30.a:0 "The wheel of violence turns again."
 rfp.31.t:0 "The Call Of The East"
 rfp.31.d:0 "Recently, the armies of the Russian Fascist Party, led by terrorist and partisan Konstantin Rodzaevsky, managed to conquer the Republic; a foreign relations disaster where we had to undergo huge evacuations for thousands of Russians, with some still living in Refugee camps in the West Coast. Rodzaevsky's rule didn't last long, though, as a clique of anti-nazi fascists took over the All Russian National Soviet in a palace coup. This group, spearheaded by long-time fascist Mikhail Matkovsky, has undone many of the previous policies of the RFP, such as the open anti-jewish campaigns.\n\nDespite the clear ideological and strategic differences, the new Vozhd Mikhail Matkovsky has made a plea to our government, asking for material help against the communists in Perm and, eventually, the nazis in Gemania.\n\nThis message is leaving our Department of State very divided. On one hand, Matkovsky is a fascist demagogue, whose armies conquered the only hope for democracy in Russia, on the other, he leads the strongest state which could just be our ticket to destroying Nazism. What should we do?"

Recieving immediate condemnation from the Toronto Accord as an illegitimate and twisted regime, the fascist powers of Europe could not be reached for a comment on the matter. As daily pogroms and armed blackshirts march throughout the countryside, the so-called "Vozhd of the Russians" Konstantin Rodzayevsky has vowed to continue the National Revolution by expanding westwards and vanquishing the last remnants of warlordism."

 rfpnews.2.d:0 "As the guns finally fall silent over the Russia after years of near-constant war and anarchy, the free territories that were untouched by Nazi conquest have finally united under the leadership of the fascist Mikhail Matkovsky and the All-Russian Fascist Front. A highly ultranationalistic and xenophobic regime, Matkovsky has vowed to exact "absolute vengance" on the Germans in the name of pan-Slavism.\n\nAs the Russian state consolidates its control over the territories once owned by the Bolsheviks, it would seem that a radical, new era is at hand for the Russian people and perhaps the world itself."

 winternational.3.d:0 "Inaugurating the conference was none other than the Vozhd Konstantin Rodzaevsky himself, to the sound of thunderous applause and sieg heils. Rodzaevsky spoke at great length about the importance of the Internatonal, a counter-balance and eventual usurper of the "Judeo-Bolshevik World Order" through mutual assistance of likeminded nations of the world.\n\nHe ended the speech with a bold threat to the Toronto Accord, stating his desire to "liberate" North America from the "vice grip of Jewish finance", which earned him a standing ovation from the massive crowd below."

 winternational.4.t:0 "Colin Jordan Speaks"
 winternational.4.d:0 "The first of the foreign representatives to speak at the Congress was the one representing the White Defence League of Great Britain, Colin Jordan.\n\nA staunch believer in the British Empire as a "white ethnostate ruling over its inferior African subjects", he firmly denounced [ENG.GetLeader]'s decolonization program as nothing more than "Zionist-funded hogwash" being encouraged by Tel Aviv itself. "Great Britain," he said, "is not a nation that was destined to sit by as the unwashed masses erode its culture. The British race was destined instead to rule the globe, to keep the African hordes and the Jew in their place."\n\nEnding his speech, Jordan said "While the British government is considered an enemy by the White Internatonal, the British race should not." Applause from the crowd was almost defeaning, if not for the some of the delegates breaking out in chorus singing "God Save The Queen"."

 winternational.5.d:0 "The next of the foreign representatives to speak at the Congress was the one representing the National States' Rights Party of the United States of America, Jesse Benjamin Stoner Jr.\n\nA former member of the Ku Klux Klan, Stoner raved at great length about "Negro degeneracy" in the United States and how liberal "Jew-minded" politicians like [USA.GetLeader] were bringing racial anarchy through his support of desegregation.\n\n"America," he said "was built by and for the white race. By no means were we meant to share our homeland with inferiors that bring nothing but violence, drugs and pollute our race with inferior genes."\n\nAs he ended the speech, he unveiled a large confederate banner next to the RFP's party flag. "The White International is the greatest conceptualization of the white man, and we of America stand by it now unto death!" "

"The Swedish nation," he declared "had only been neutral in the war due to Judeo-Bolshevik meddling in the King's affairs!"\n\n"The Nords of Sweden, Germanics of Germany and the Slavs of Russia shall one day stand united under the glorious banner of the White International!" he concluded, recieving respectful applause from the gallery below."

 winternational.7.t:0 "René Binet Speaks"
 winternational.7.d:0 "The last of the foreign representatives to speak at the Congress was the one representing the vast array of fascist and nazi partiies in France, René Binet.\n\nA follower of Jacques Doriot, he had been a veteran of the SS Charlemagne Division and a prolific writer on the topics of biological realism and racialist theories. Now head of the Paris-based European Social Movement, he had long advocated for a pan-European white state that would stand strong against the "African and Arab masses that attempt to destroy human civilization".\n\nHe was perhaps the most enthusiastic of all about the White International, and his speech reflected this.\n\n"France has endured many hardships over the past two decades," he said quietly "but our national rebirth has given the French people a second chance at greatness! I speak for all patriotic Frenchmen when I say that we, as do the civilized peoples of Europe stand with the Vozhd in his dream for fascist unity worldwide!""

We, of course, have zero intention of ever bringing ourselves in with the same crowd as such untermensch, especially ones that mock the late Fuhrer.
