 GGP.1.t:0 "Intelligenzaktion II"
 GGP.1.d:0 "It did not take a long time for the government to pay attention to the threats that could endanger the stability of the state, and those threats came from intellectual circles whose activities could have drastic consequences for everything that has been done so far. The directive issued within the government itself was such that a list of suspicious people was drawn up, who could be involved in various embezzlements and conspiracies directed against the government, and it was therefore decided to "review their loyalty for the general interest of the state."\n\nOn the night that covered the city, the police, in cooperation with special detachments that came from the army, organized raids on houses that belonged to all the "suspicious" people on the list. Taking them away either in handcuffs, or unconscious from the beatings that followed the resistance during the arrest, every man who was a suspect found himself behind bars, anxious about what would happen to them next and their entire destiny, which was now cut short..."
 GGP.1.a:0 "Down with the intelligentsia!"
 
 GGP.2.t:0 "Purge of Corrupt Officials"
 GGP.2.d:0 "Under a mysterious invitation, which came directly from their leader, a large number of people, somewhere around 100 to 150 of them, gathered in the meeting room within the government itself. No one expected anything, nor did they question the fact that they were invited in the middle of the night to hold a small meeting which, according to all estimates, would be irrelevant and trivial. No one noticed that the army was patrolling around the buildings, nor could they actually notice them since they were hidden, waiting for an order to attack. As they entered the government building, footsteps could be heard coming from the stairs and they saw several people being accompanied by special detachments from the army while carrying some lists with them.\n\nThey started shouting names out loud, when suddenly, the army stormed the building, surrounding everyone present, and being especially careful not to run away those whose names were on the roll call. After the "roll call" was carried out, it was ordered that all those who were called out be taken out on the street, their faces lit up and everyone awake at that moment be shown what they had done to deserve such treatment. Individuals on the list fell to their knees, begging to be acquitted so that their demands for redemption would come in the form of an order: "If you want to live so much, pledge your allegiance to us and kill your fellow colleagues who came before us as traitors."\n\nTogether with the army, they took to the streets, turning on the lights around and banging very loudly to wake up as many people as possible. This happened while certain detachments broke into houses and dragged their tenants to the streets to attend to this act. Holding weapons in their hands, the survivors from the list were ordered to raise their weapons at the commander's signal, aim and fall. Looking at their allies and colleagues until recently, the politicians on the list could only feel the betrayal that smelled like gunpowder from the bullets that hit them, knocking them to the ground without further ado. People could not believe what they saw, remaining motionless and silent about the current event. With a few small words, as well as orders not to touch anything, the army left the area around the government building, returning to its regular duties."
 GGP.2.a:0 "The corpses read: I betrayed my country."
 
 GGP.3.t:0 "Raiders"
 GGP.3.d:0 "Grey and feldgrau trucks race across the torn dirt roads of Eastern Polen. The tops of their flatbeds covered by tan canvas, which bounces and sways in the motion of the vehicle. Sitting inside, with the standard battledress of the Wehrmacht, eight men, a full “Trupp” or squad of german soldiers. Some have scars, some have wisps of blond or brown hair just below the fringes of their stahlhelms. The first two on the port and starboard sides of the bed carried belt-fed GPMGs, a sort of modernised MG-42 used by their alte kameraden. The next four on either side carried G43s, modernised with sturdier stocks and of cheaper make. Their uniforms were different too, whereas the other soldiers wore panzergrenadier greens and browns, but these wore simple tan uniforms. These were the auxiliaries, soldiers levied from the rural populace and turned into loyal machines of the state through propaganda. Finally, the last on the port carried a backpack filled with spare ammunition and an MP-47, an updated MP-40. The final man, on the starboard side, wore a field cap rather than a helmet, he was worn, and old. His uniform carried the insignia of an officer, a Leutnant to be precise, and he sat straight back. Merely his attitude in which he glanced at his men put a sense of seriousness in the air, which his men, as they realised they were nearing their objective, returned, sitting up straighter, and checking their weapons.\n\nFinally they arrived. A small group of shacks and houses, with a tractor out from and row upon row of muddy field surrounding it, fenced in with birch logs. The trucks stopped at different spots, one at a crossroads, where its soldiers discharged and got into positions to guard. The second stopped half way to the muddy track which led to the cottage, its crew dismounting and climbing over the fence to advance on the buildings. Finally, the last vehicle stopped at the entrance to the driveway, blocking it and unloading its men in a charge down the track. The MG carriers set up and fired a few shots into each building, while the riflemen and auxiliaries Ran forward. By now their presence was noticed, and three children ran out, waving their hands in the air. Acting on sheer instinct, a machine gun cut down one, and took out the leg of another. The soldiers arrived and yelled in a language they did not speak, they began to cry. Finally one of the auxiliaries approached and began to calm the children. Now more filed out, waving white handkerchiefs.\n\nWith everyone rounded up, the Leutnant waved for the trucks to approach, and soon gleeful expressions grew on the faces of the men. They ran into each house, two went for the stables and one for the chicken coup. The women of the farm cried, then men sat with rageful expressions pointed at the ground. The second squad ran in now, desperate to get their hands on some of the spoils. Out came the first load a few minutes later, an ancient chandelier, some bottles of wine, loaves of bread. From the chicken coup the soldier carried three, and from the stable one carried a pig, and the other a sheep. This continued for almost thirty minutes. Eventually, it seems the germans were satisfied with their loot. They mounted up, yelled something, and drove away. One truck after the other."
 GGP.3.a:0 "Such is life."
 
 GGP.4.t:0 "Settlers to Poland?"
 GGP.4.d:0 "The Generalgouvernement has announced a series of financial incentives for our citizens, encouraging as many of them to settle in Poland as possible."
 GGP.4.a:0 "Of course - we would be happy to!"
 GGP.4.b:0 "It is a lost cause. We will not send our men to die in Poland."
 
 GGP.5.t:0 "[FROM.GetAdjective] Settlers Arrive"
 GGP.5.d:0 "Bidding farewell to their homeland, settlers from the [FROM.GetName] have arrived. They spoke a different tongue than the locals, bringing along new ideas and the hope for a better life."
 GGP.5.a:0 "Fantastic!"

 GGP.6.t:0 "Meeting with IG Farben"
 GGP.6.d:0 "In strict secrecy, the answer came after the government sent an invitation to the directors of IG Farben stationed in Frankfurt. The letter read:\n"Dear directors of IG Farben, we are addressing you so that we can establish an agreement that would be beneficial to both parties, both us and you. If you are interested, we will meet at the government building in three days, around midnight. We look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Don't let us wait."\nThe letter then reached the hands of the director of "IG Farben", who, with a small, hateful but determined attitude, decided to respond immediately to this letter, being aware of the fact that could happen to him if he did not cooperate with the government. The letter was concise, leaving the impression of a man who was ready for various agreements.\n"Our delegation will come to the government building, as you have determined."\n"Sir, should we start preparations?" Was a short question to the man reading the letter. "Yes. Tell everyone in charge of the organization to do it as soon as possible. We don't need excessive glamor. ”He replied to set the letter aside and pick up the phone. "Bring me a war minister." "We understand, sir." A voice on the other end of the wire replied.\n\n"So that would be your plan?" Asked a delegate who arrived from IG Farben after hearing what government officials had to say to them. "Production of chemical weapons?" "Do you have any problems with resources or anything that could damage these plans?" "We have everything we need, only this request threw us a little out of step, nothing more. We'll be able to start production in a week if you don't have a problem with that." "Great. You will keep us informed of everything that is happening and will keep this a top-secret, without any excessive demands on your part." "We understand.""
 GGP.6.a:0 "Chemical warfare." 

 GGP.7.t:0 "Polish Fever"
 GGP.7.d:0 "The life of a Polish medic admittedly became much more interesting following the German invasion. Before your average doctor only occasionally handled a workplace accident, now besides every accident being multiplied by ten because of utter German disregard for Polish lives doctors also had to contend with very exciting conditions such as gunshots, all manner of injuries caused by bombings, and the most exciting of all, anthrax.\n\nIt was utter chaos at the Radom hospital. The hospital not only had to deal with the constant stream of conventional bombings around and inside the city, but now also with anthrax bombings, causing hundreds of infamously hard to cure and infectious anthrax infectees showing up every week, which has visibly taken the toll on the hospital staff. One of those hospital staff was Klara, who could only think about one thing while treating what felt like the ninth case of a child with severe anthrax that day."
 GGP.7.a:0 "The Germans will pay for this!"

 GGP.8.t:0 "Germans Propose Peace"
 GGP.8.d:0 "The recent offer forwarded to us by the General Government has caused a lot of internal content within our high command. The offer would turn the General Government into an imperial protectorate meaning much more autonomy to our people, however this wouldn’t be even close to the independence we wish for. The side proposing that we accept the offer says that full independence is not possible, meaning that we must accept whatever we can get. However, the other side also claims that accepting the offer would also betray the resistance and would just bring the Polish people back under the German yoke, and the autonomy would just mean a slower demise for Polish culture. However, which side is right falls upon you, and whatever choice you make is sure to be supported by the majority."
 GGP.8.a:0 "We accept."
 GGP.8.b:0 "Decline the offer!"

 GGP.9.t:0 "Poland Agrees to Peace"
 GGP.9.d:0 ""Sir, we have important news!" "What happened?" The half-frightened man asked, not expecting anyone to break into his office this way. "Read for yourself." The man opened a letter signed by a clumsy Polish hand and began reading out the last sentences. "Despite everything that has happened since the war began, we understand the necessity of peace that would contribute to the end of the massacre that has been going on since the war began. We agree to the terms presented to our delegation and consider them fair and sufficient to enable us to accept the request. Peace be with you."Rolling up the letter, satisfied with the results achieved, a little dissatisfied because he failed to kill all the Poles, the man breathed a sigh of relief. "Does this mean we succeeded?" "It depends on the perspective.""
 GGP.9.a:0 ""My perspective is that we couldn't have done better.""

 GGP.10.t:0 "Poland Refuses Our Offer"
 GGP.10.d:0 ""Are these miserable, poor excuses for a human being serious?!" The Minister of War slammed his fist on the table, trying to get the word out after the discussion about the announcement of the Polish response to the armistice broke out. "They are miserable, but that is not our current problem now! We have to come up with a new plan that will bring those dirty Poles to their knees! They can't just refuse our requests! After all, we burned them and scorched them wherever we met!” “Then what do you recommend we do to the Poles?” said the man who convened this meeting in a calm voice, previously informed of the Polish response. "I think we still have to wait, but of course we must not order our troops to withdraw from the front. I also have another idea.” “Shall we hear it?” “We will go deeper into Polish territory and repeat almost everything we have done so far. That way we'll exhaust them and squeeze the truces out of them." "Who agrees?""
 GGP.10.a:0 "Ja!"

 GGP_The_Civil_Administration_desc:0 "It is important to remember that we are on a civilizing mission in a foreign land. While the military might of the German garrison is unquestioned for now, we should not neglect the civil administrative side of the Generalgouvernement."
 GGP_Franks_Dictatorship:0 "Frank's Dictatorship"
 GGP_Franks_Dictatorship_desc:0 "Hans Frank's legal expertise means that he's a more cautious and reserved decision-maker than most in the NSDAP. If the Reich home office were to vest more power in his office, he can be trusted not to misuse it."
 GGP_Invite_the_Conglomerates:0 "Invite the Conglomerates"
 GGP_Invite_the_Conglomerates_desc:0 "It would greatly benefit the colonial economy if a firm like Krupp or Siemens invested more heavily in the region's industry. Let's reach out to agents from these companies to see if any of them would be interested in financing a business venture or two and taking advantage of the glut of cheap labour."
 GGP_Attract_German_Settlers:0 "Attract German Settlers"
 GGP_Attract_German_Settlers_desc:0 "The wild Polish frontier will become less wild and Polish the more Germanized it gets. What are some ways we could attract more settlers from metropolitan Germany? Surely a few monetary incentives would do the trick."
 GGP_Brave_New_World:0 "A Brave New World"
 GGP_Brave_New_World_desc:0 "We need to stop thinking of the Generalgouvernement as a separate entity from the broader Reich. While the job isn't quite finished yet, eventually the region will be predominantly Aryan. The efforts to integrate the region with metropolitan Germany ought to be stepped up."
 GGP_Reform_the_Administration:0 "Reform the Administration"
 GGP_Reform_the_Administration_desc:0 "We've known for a while that a certain amount of corruption and inefficiency plagues the regional administration. If we want to be better colonizers, we need to be more disciplined when it comes to such impropriety. Some reform is in order. As proud Aryan men, we ought to run a tighter ship."
 GGP_Establish_German_Colonial_Districts:0 "Establish German Colonial Districts"
 GGP_Establish_German_Colonial_Districts_desc:0 "It has been suggested for years that more power should be placed in the hands of local settler governments. Perhaps it is time for a top-down reorganisation of settled land. Only ethnic Germans have full citizenship, so we will divide the region along racial lines."
 GGP_Expand_the_Agriculture_Sectors:0 "Expand the Agriculture Sectors"
 GGP_Expand_the_Agriculture_Sectors_desc:0 "Our analysts suggest that we could attain a 7.0% higher barley yields if our slaves' working hours were extended. While it may cause them personal discomfort to have less leisure time, they should understand that the Reich is relying on the Generalgouvernment's agricultural output."
 GGP_Establish_the_Polnische_Justizpolizei:0 "Establish the Polnische Justizpolizei"
 GGP_Establish_the_Polnische_Justizpolizei_desc:0 "The Poles are an unruly and irritable race. Controlling them has never been easy, so maybe it would be in our best interest to tap certain Poles to keep their fellows in line."
 GGP_The_Native_Tax:0 "The Native Tax"
 GGP_The_Native_Tax_desc:0 "We need more money to fund our various operations in the region. Seeing as we don't seek to put a dent in the prosperity of our settlers, we should raise taxes on natives. Our financial advisors suggest we could still squeeze a little more revenue out of the native population if we tightened our grip."
 GGP_Attract_Nordic_Settlers:0 "Attract Nordic Settlers"
 GGP_Attract_Nordic_Settlers_desc:0 "While we would prefer German settlers first and foremost, we shouldn't turn down lesser Aryans from the Nordic countries. If there are any committed Nazis in Scandinavia who'd like to homestead the Polish frontier, there's no reason for us to turn them away."
 GGP_German_Civil_War:0 "The German Civil War"
 GGP_German_Civil_War_desc:0 "It has been an open secret for years that the Generalgouvernement is deeply unstable, even by the low standards of the other Reichskommissariats. The death of Hitler is putting the state's fragile infrastructure to the ultimate test. We are severely ill-equipped to deal with Witold Pileki and his massive popular uprising."
 GGP_Conscript_the_Security_Forces:0 "Conscript the Security Forces"
 GGP_Conscript_the_Security_Forces_desc:0 "We need more bodies to throw at the rebels. We could press the security forces into full military service to give us a slight edge. It's not much of an advantage, but it's better than nothing."
 GGP_Support_the_Righful_Government:0 "Support the Rightful Government"
 GGP_Support_the_Righful_Government_desc:0 "It is disgusting that so many usurpers are jockeying for control of the Reich. The fuhrer's body is just now getting cold and the vultures are already picking at the remains of the nation he built. We owe it to his memory to support the so-called "rightful government" in this struggle."
 GGP_Protect_Our_Neutrality:0 "Protect Our Neutrality"
 GGP_Protect_Our_Neutrality_desc:0 "In the interest of maintaining stability, we ought to make it known that the Generalgouvernement will remain neutral in this conflict. We have enough problems as it is. The native insurrection poses an existential threat to our power. What we don't need is another front to fight on."
 GGP_Empower_the_Government:0 "Empower the Government"
 GGP_Empower_the_Government_desc:0 "We can't expect much aid from the home office in this fight. As such, we'll have to operate semi-autonomously for the future with minimal external support. It'd be nice if we could make this change under better circumstances, but necessity demands that we act at once."
 GGP_Maintain_Basic_Functions:0 "Maintain Basic Functions"
 GGP_Maintain_Basic_Functions_desc:0 "It is of the utmost importance that we try to preserve the status quo to the greatest extent we can. We will not be operating at full efficiency (far from it) but our government will survive for the foreseeable future. If we play our cards right, we can limp along towards an uncertain future instead of collapsing completely."
 GGP_Combat_the_Polish_Resistance:0 "Combat the Polish Resistance"
 GGP_Combat_the_Polish_Resistance_desc:0 "The rebels are ruthless. If they successfully overthrow our government, there will be no mercy for the settlers. We have to be worse than them if we want the will of the Aryan people to prevail."
 GGP_Hold_Warschau:0 "Hold Warschau!"
 GGP_Hold_Warschau_desc:0 "We cannot let Warschau fall to the rebels under any circumstances. If Warschau goes, Krakau will be next. These are the two biggest cities we still decisively control… for now. We need to prepare the defenses at once for the impending sieges."
 GGP_Fight_Fire_with_Fire:0 "Fight Fire with  Fire"
 GGP_Fight_Fire_with_Fire_desc:0 "We will make sure that the Subhumans get nothing from us even after we die! We will burn everything and salt the land until we either win or perish!"
 GGP_Promise_Death_to_Rebels:0 "Promise Death to Rebels"
 GGP_Promise_Death_to_Rebels_desc:0 "We need to be as hard on the rebels as possible. Any native suspected of harboring pro-resistance sympathies has forfeited their right to live. Treasonous thought and behavior will be punished by death without trial. Only with a strong hand can we hope to hold on."
 GGP_Virus_Warfare:0 "Virus Warfare"
 GGP_Virus_Warfare_desc:0 "We are losing and we're losing quite badly. Drastic times call for drastic measures. We have many biological weapons on-hand that were concocted in concentration camp labs across Polen. Many in our administration have been hesitant to cross this line, but this is a matter of life or death for our administration. The natives can't resist us if they're too sick to shoulder a rifle."
 GGP_Promise_Polish_Autonomy:0 "Promise Polish Autonomy"
 GGP_Promise_Polish_Autonomy_desc:0 "Much to the chagrin of the more conservative officials in our government, we have decided to offer individual natives greater rights and autonomy if they side with us against the rebels. They still won't have full citizenship but they'll live better than they have since the 1939 invasion."
 GGP_The_Polish_Volunteers:0 "The Ukrainian Volunteers"
 GGP_The_Polish_Volunteers_desc:0 "The Ukrainian volunteers we have acquired are going to be organized into native brigades, which will be attached to garrison forces and assigned to anti-partisan duties. Although the recruitment of collaborationist Ukrainians has drawn bitter grumbling from many settlers and hardline ideologues on our side, they understand that the future of the Generalgouvernement hinges on how much manpower we can marshal. These collaborator forces may just give us the edge we need to pull through."
