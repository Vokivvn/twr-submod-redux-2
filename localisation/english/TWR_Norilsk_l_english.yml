NRI_The_Autonomous_Countryside_desc:0 "Outside of the few population centers, power projection of the Norilsk government is weak in the remote parts of the Governate. While these regions are still technically under our influence, local communities function more similarly to independent villages and trade leagues."

NRI_A_Lack_of_Supplies_desc:0 "While Norilsk might be rich in resources, the lack of viable food sources in the entirety of the Governate has created a major crisis. While the city is currently kept afloat by frequent trading for supplies in exchange for raw materials, if this fragile balance were to be broken, it might very well be the end of the government."

#Leaders
Pavel_Frenkel_DESC:0 "Pavel Andreyevich Frankov, born in 1904 in Moscow, educated as a mechanic and locksmith, was one of the many political prisoners during a period of political purges in the Soviet Union. He was sentenced to 10 years of hard labour in the Norillag.\n\nUnder the Kalinin premiership, Beria's reign as interior minister resulted in more and more prisoners being relocated or sent to the Norillag. He began to form a group within the GULAG system, plotting a series of strikes demanding better treatment. However, before any actual strikes could happen, the prison was shut down and the prisoners were granted amnesty. During this period of utter confusion, Pavel Frenkel organized the stranded personnel, forming an ad-hoc government and bringing democracy to the region."
Leonid_Brezhnev_DESC:0 "First sentenced by Lavrentiy Beria to rot in the Norillag, Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev's political life is more than legendary.\n\nFirst serving as a political commissar in the Great Patriotic War, Leonid Brezhnev caught the attention of the party and recieved quick promotions during early period of Perm government. However, as Kalinin's authority evaporated under the Malenkov-Beria diarchy, Brezhnev was targeted by Beria, resulting in his imprisonment in Norillag. However, during the chaotic period of Yeniseysk democracy, Brezhnev became the dominant figure of the syncretic party of Norilsk Communist Socialist Party. While his party reached out to the reactionaries, Brezhnev himself remained a dedicated Marxist, and incoporated aspects of Nationalism and Bolshevism, appealing to both Marxist theory and the locals' traditionalist sentiments."
Jaba_Ioseliani_DESC:0 "Jaba Ioseliani is a criminal turned commander. Born on July 10, 1926 in Khashuri, Ioseliani was insignificant. Soon after the retreat to Perm however, Ioseliani was one of the many citizens that have relocated eastwards. In 1944, he was arrested for robbery in the city of Sverdlovsk and was sentenced to 11 years of hard labour in the Norillag.\n\nDuring the revolution of the Norillag prisoners, Ioseliani organized the Norilsk Militia, becoming a prominent fighting force before the arrival of the defectors. Since then, his Militia unit became the police unit of Norilsk, granting him significance as the commander of the city's stability."
Ivan_Vrachov_DESC:0 "Ivan Yakovlevich Vrachev was born in 1898. As a revolutionary and a soldier, Vrachev joined the Bolsheviks in 1917 and quickly became involved with party affairs and military affairs. Vrachev served as a commissar at the front, and after the successful formation of the Soviet Union, Vrachev became a delegate of the  All-Union Congresses of Soviets and the All-Russian Congresses of Soviets. And in 1923, Vrachev joined the Left Opposition and became a signatory of the "The Declaration of 46". Soon after Trotsky's fall from grace, Vrachev was expelled from the party and oppressed. Vrachev became a victim of regular exiling.\n\nHowever, at the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, Vrachev successfully convinced Stalin to allow Vrachev to return to military duties as a private. While he became a soldier once again, he did not see much action during the war, being assigned to garrison duties in the Far East. As the reality of the Beria-Malenkov diarchy began to materialize, Vrachev was once again suppressed, and this time, he was exiled to Norilsk. In Norilsk, he saw his chance at reviving the eternal revolution, convincing many of the convicts and fellow Trotskyists to form the Alternative Communist Party, the true leaders of the revolution."
Alexander_Sirotkin_DESC:0 "Alexander Savelievich Sirotkin is a military man. While he was never a resident nor a prisoner of Norillag, a strange twist of fate would result in Lieutenant General and NKVD Division Commander Sirotkin going over to the prisoners' revolution.\n\nIn his earlier days, Sirotkin was a soldier in the Imperial Army. After the October Revolution in November 1917, he went over to the Bolsheviks and fought for them in the subsequent civil war. On November 10, 1936, he was appointed head of the Border and Internal Protection Directorate of the NKVD of the West Siberian Military District. During the Norilsk Uprising, Sirotkin's unit was tasked with the revolt's suppression, but similar to how he went over to the Bolsheviks before, Sirotkin and his unit went over t othe revolution, forming the backbone of Yeniseysk's military power. Since then, he became a prominent figure in Norilsk politics, and would lead the militarist Vanguard Party to political significance."
Alexandra_Zelenskaya_DESC:0 "Aleksandra Matveevna Zelenskaya, born in 1927 lived her life as an ordinary citizen. Zelenskaya was one of the many Ukrainians that fled from Ukraine when it became concrete that the Germans had no intention of treating Ukrainians as equals. Zelenskaya started her new life as a member of a collective farm near Orenburg. However, old documents and reports from partisan cells implicated Zelenskaya, she was accused of cooperating with the infamous UPA during her time in occupied Ukraine and wa subsequently sent to the Norillag.\n\nDuring the start of the Norilsk Revolution, Zelenskaya became leader of the women's section, representing the female prisoners and became a movement leader. Zelenskaya continued and expanded her scope of leadership after the success, becoming the chairperson of the Socialist Party, representing minority democratic interests in the political system."
Nikolay_Urvantsev_DESC:0 "Nikolay Nikolayevich Urvantsev, born in 1893, worked as a geologist and explorer. Most notably, Urvantsev's expedition practically found the location of Norilsk and was responsibile for the first house built in what grew to become the city of Norilsk. Of course, Urvantsev went on more expeditions and was a relatively renowned explorer at the time. However, in 1938, he was arrested and sentenced to 15 years in correctional camps. In February 1940, the sentence was overturned for lack of corpus delicti, but in August Urvantsev was again arrested and sentenced to 8 years. Urvantsev had to serve his sentence in Karlag and ultimately, Norillag.\n\nFrom becoming a founder of the city to becoming a wronged prisoner in the same city which he discovered, the irony was never lost on Urvantsev. In Norillag, Urvantsev was contacted by the underground democratic resistance network of the Party For the Democratization of Russia (PDR). Urvantsev joined the organization and became secretary of the organization in Norilsk. After the successful revolution, Urvantsev's wing of the PDR went public, becoming an elitist political party operating within Norilsk, maintaining close communication with the other PDR cells."
Walter_Ciszek_DESC:0 "Walter Joseph Ciszek is an American-Polish Jesuit priest who conducted clandestine missionary work in the Soviet Union. Born on November 4, 1904, in the mining town of Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, Ciszek entered the Jesuit novitiate in Poughkeepsie, New York in 1928. He volunteered to serve as a missionary to Russia. In 1934, Ciszek was sent to Rome to study at the Pontifical Russian College. In 1938, Ciszek was sent to the Jesuit mission in Albertyn in eastern Poland. After the Soviet Union occupied eastern Poland and forced Ciszek to close his mission, he arrived in Lviv. Ciszek realized that it would be very easy for a priest to enter the Soviet Union amid the streams of exiles going East. After securing the permission of higher church authorities, he crossed the border in 1940 under the identity of Władymyr Łypynski. He traveled to the logging town of Chusovoy, in the Ural Mountains and worked as a logger while discreetly performing religious ministry, before being discovered by the NKVD and sentenced to 15 years of hard labour for espionage.\n\nHe was sent to serve in the Norillag, and even in the camp, Ciszek used his Russian language skills to perform secret religious work within the prison. He was a passive participant in the Norilsk Revolution, but his ministry work built him a solid supporter network within the city, leading to the decision to form a political party based on Christian values."

When the Great Patriotic War was seemingly lost, authorities in the remote regions of Siberia started to panic, an issue that was only worsened when Stalin vanished without a trace.\n\nWhen Mikhail Kalinin took over and focused on the issues of European Russia, more and more prisoners arrived in Norillag, as camps in Western Russia began to grow vulnerable to the impending German advance. As the prison population increased, support and funding from Perm stagnated. As the situation continued to deteriorate, Lavrentiy Beria finally took control of the union. This was the final straw for the prisoners of Norillag, as Beria announced the halt of all funding for the Norillag alongside a general amnesty, an amnesty that granted them the freedom, but not the means to travel home.\n\nAt the same time, chaos unfolded in Norillag's nearby regions, Soviet pretender governments rose up against Beria, combining this with a great number of stranded prisoners and a handful of guards, the people of Norillag launched a revolution, first overthrowing the camp authorities, and soon took over the entire city of Norilsk. When the officials of the region telegraphed both Soviet governments, asking for reinforcements, both sides were preoccupied and were building up for a conflict to become the legitimate government. Two days after the successful revolution, the commissar of Norilsk managed to convince Perm to send Alexander Sirotkin's military formation to pacify the situation. But, when the reinforcements finally arrived, Alexander Sirotkin and his officers were sickened by the endless bickering in the Soviet Union and decided to go over, joining the revolution in forming a new government.\n\nSince then, the Norilsk government functioned independently without much interference. An independent socialist republic was declared, and the abandoned rural communities around Yeniseysk sent their own representatives, forming a loose self-defense coalition under the flag of a neutral, independent Republic. The big shots of Norillag became the politicians of this young republic, first they drafted a constitution, then they created a "parliament", formed dozens of political parties, and appointed themselves as deputies. However, despite all of these democratic gestures, the situation remains strange blend of representative democracy more akin to mob rule, with power residing in the ones with the most vocal supporters."
twrnorilsk.1.a:0 "Moving forward."

twrnorilsk.2.t:0 "The Rebirth of Norilsk"
twrnorilsk.2.d:0 "Once a city in despair and cut off from the world, Norilsk was in desperate need of help. Our leaders know this terrible situation, and finally with enough resources gathered, the city of Norilsk is beginning to recover, finally regaining life and a sense of hope for her citizens."
twrnorilsk.2.a:0 "A brand new city!"

twrnorilsk.3.t:0 "Emergency Meeting"
twrnorilsk.3.d:0 "Surrounded on all sides, Yeniseysk is in a tough spot. A meeting between the LRSP and the militia leaders revealed how dire the situation really is. Plans have been drafted, leaders hope that a comprhensive strategy can hold off their enemies as long as possible."
twrnorilsk.3.a:0 "The situation is dire."

twrnorilsk.4.t:0 "A Meeting of Leaders"
twrnorilsk.4.d:0 "Politicians, local landlords, village mayors, all local representatives have gathered in Norilsk; all participating for a unified goal - to resolve the looming political crisis between the city and the rural settlements.\n\nThe LRSP dominated the discussions, managing to convince many local leaders to agree to Norilsk demands. After a few hours of heated debate, the leaders of Yeniseysk have came to an agreement, proclaiming their willingness to cooperate in times of trouble."
twrnorilsk.4.a:0 "We must work together!"

twrnorilsk.5.t:0 "Protests Against Tax Code"
twrnorilsk.5.d:0 "Enraged by our decision to reform the broken tax system, a crowd of protestors gathered in the city of Norilsk. The rowdy crowd demanded the changes to be reverted, calling the LRSP government "thieves and leeches".\n\nMilitiamen armed with wooden batons have been sent to handle the situation."
twrnorilsk.5.a:0 "Concerning news."

twrnorilsk.6.t:0 "A Socialist Confederation"
twrnorilsk.6.d:0 "With a territory encompassing a large chunk of Siberia, the system of government was certainly outdated. As part of the LRSP's party agenda, the Yeniseysk Governorate has been transformed into a Confederation.\n\nWith local political entities supporting the confederation, this act marks another step for Yeniseysk to fully modernize its apparatus, a stepping stone for Yeniseysk to become a proper state."
twrnorilsk.6.a:0 "For the workers and peasants!"

twrnorilsk.601.t:0 "Yeniseysk Passports"
twrnorilsk.601.d:0 "Issued by the Yeniseysk-Norilsk Postal Service, the Yeniseysk Passports serve as both identity document and as travelling document. Since the postal service only operates a handful of facilities outside of Norilsk, these passports are hard to attain and are extremely rare.\n\nThis scheme is part of LRSP's platform to modernize the country, the LRSP government also claims that by using a passport, citizens of the Confederation will be able to enter other countries legally, despite the fact that not a single state on Earth has recognized the legitimacy of this document."
twrnorilsk.601.a:0 "How would this work...?"

twrnorilsk.7.t:0 "Signing of the First Constitution"
twrnorilsk.7.d:0 ""Entrusted by the people, the Confederation and her government shall protect the rights, liberties, and lives of her subjects.\n\nThe towns, cities, villages, and all forms of settlements under the jurisdiction of the Confederation will follow this constitution, and will provide their utmost to preserve the Confederation and its way of system. Under the notion of mutual respect, subjects must respect the Confederation's legitimacy, and failure to do so indicates forfeit of the rights preserved by this constitution.\n\nArticle I, the Structure of the Confederation...""
twrnorilsk.7.a:0 "Long live the Confederation!"

twrnorilsk.8.t:0 "Formation of Military Districts"
twrnorilsk.8.d:0 "Local captains have be assigned into different military districts, given resources and trust to prepare military affairs that would serve to protect the Norilsk administration.\n\nThese military districts greatly appreciate the leadership of the AP, promising to serve the administration as long as the militia's influence is respected."
twrnorilsk.8.a:0 "For smoother administration!"

twrnorilsk.801.t:0 "Bread Riots"
twrnorilsk.801.d:0 "Unable to cope with the situation in Norilsk, rowdy citizens started bread riots. State Bakeries were raided and looted by rioters, and militiamen armed with bolt action rifles were sent to handle the situation."
twrnorilsk.801.a:0 "Oh no!"

twrnorilsk.9.t:0 "Military-Police-Jury Courts"
twrnorilsk.9.d:0 "With the police and military being indistinguishable in Yeniseysk, the AP government has finally decided to finalize this situation.\n\nA system of Military-Police-Jury has been announced, giving milita policemen the authority to hold "trials" on location, effectively ending judicial processes in police action. Part of the reason why AP has decided to make such a decision is based on the argument that the state simply "do not have enough qualified judges and lawyers"."
twrnorilsk.9.a:0 "Maximum efficiency!"

twrnorilsk.10.t:0 "Declaration of the Republic"
twrnorilsk.10.d:0 "Viewing themselves as a viable candidate of reunification, the AP government has strongarmed delegations into agreeing with the formation of a Unitary Republic.\n\nWith local authorities now under control of the AP-loyal militias, the notion of democratic participation and devolution has completely shattered."
twrnorilsk.10.a:0 "A true contender!"

twrnorilsk.11.t:0 "The Red Banner"
twrnorilsk.11.d:0 "Gathered in the Norilsk Parliament House, a formal declaration was made by the AP.\n\nThe AP declares itself to be the legitimate government of Russia, calling all other political entities currently occupying parts of Russia as rebel governments. They declared their intentions to reunify the motherland, and to bring fellow Russian citizens under the administration of the AP.\n\nWhile openly hostile, this speech was made in secret, and only reported within the confines of Norilsk."
twrnorilsk.11.a:0 "Glory to the workers!"

twrnorilsk.12.t:0 "The Vanguards of the Revolution"
twrnorilsk.12.d:0 "As the true successors of Trotskyist ideals, the true vanguard of the communist revolution is now the only unquestioned leader of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe ruling party has officially condemned all other socialist parties around Russia and retroactively banned any future socialist organizations in Norilsk.\n\nStalin's legacy must be exterminated, and only the true vanguard can accomplish this herculean task."
twrnorilsk.12.a:0 "His spirit shall lead us!"

twrnorilsk.13.t:0 "The Restless Revolution"
twrnorilsk.13.d:0 "The eternal revolution will not rest until the world achieves total communism! The Alternative Party promises a total victory of the proletarian peoples, and swear that the revolution will not rest until it is truly fulfilled."
twrnorilsk.13.a:0 "The Revolution waits for noone!"

twrnorilsk.14.t:0 "Expelling of the Elites"
twrnorilsk.14.d:0 "Landlords and capitalists residing in Norilsk have been rounded up and expelled from the city.\n\nOf course, with great generosity and forgiveness, the government allowed them to take one briefcase of personal belongings and then they were given the right to travel to anywhere after leaving the city perimeter.\n\nWith no means of transportation for their journey south.\n\nStarting from the Arctic circle in freezing conditions."
twrnorilsk.14.a:0 "Good riddance."

twrnorilsk.15.t:0 "Commissars Reintroduced"
twrnorilsk.15.d:0 "There is a great deal of animosity between former Norillag prisoners and political commissars, since many of these prisoners arrived to Norilsk thanks to the tyranny of political commissars.\n\nHowever, none can deny their effectiveness in sustaining morale. For our humble military to even have a chance against the other regional powers, the commissar system must be reintroduced. Morale and political cohesion on the battlefield must be maintained at all cost necessary."
twrnorilsk.15.a:0 "Just a little morale booster."

twrnorilsk.16.t:0 "The True Soviets"
twrnorilsk.16.d:0 "In history, false idols rise and fall, but the workers are forever eternal.\n\nMuch like the schism of the past, these false idols are claiming to be the true leaders of the working men, while they feasted like kings on the blood and sweat of the suffering folk.\n\nNo longer shall this situation be tolerated, for the true representative of the Soviet people is here. We are the flag bearer of Lenin's will, the sons of Trotsky's cause, and most importantly..."
twrnorilsk.16.a:0 "We are the only representative of the working class!"

twrnorilsk.150.t:0 "Clerical Commissars"
twrnorilsk.150.d:0 "Under the directive of the Communist Party, a new unit of commissars have been trained.\n\nThese commissars are faithful Orthodox men, being able to inspire their fellow soldiers with the word of god. However, what sets them apart from the average preacher is their ability to incoporate Orthodox scripture with the words of Lenin or Marx. When they try to inspire the people, they hold their small Suppedaneum cross and a peasant's sickle high in the air.\n\nWith the word of god and the teachings of communism, they will surely be unstoppable."
twrnorilsk.150.a:0 "God shall guide our battles!"

twrnorilsk.17.t:0 "Opening of the Food Storage"
twrnorilsk.17.d:0 "The previous LRSP government withheld valuable bread storages from the general public in the name of "security" and "saving it for a future crisis". We will open the food storage and our administration will become incredibly popular, saving for the future is not our obligation.\n\nSatisfy the immediate needs of the workers, and later on, if they encounter hardships, they will understand that it is their personal failure and suffering for the greater good."
twrnorilsk.17.a:0 "Bread for all useful citizens!"

twrnorilsk.170.t:0 "Prayers and Marx"
twrnorilsk.170.d:0 "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.\nThy paradise come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\nGive us this day our daily bread;\nand forgive us our trespasses\nas we forgive those who trespass against us;\nand lead us not into temptation,\nbut deliver us from evil."
twrnorilsk.170.a:0 "Jesus was the first socialist afterall."

twrnorilsk.18.t:0 "Deportation of Arctic Peoples"
twrnorilsk.18.d:0 "The natives of Arctic Siberia simply do not deserve the land. It is the government's responsibility to prepare these lands for our fellow Slavs.\n\nOur troops have ordered these people to march south, and during this journey, it is their responsibility to feed themselves and keep themselves warm.\n\nOfficial estimation expects little to no survivors."
twrnorilsk.18.a:0 "These subhumans don't belong here."

twrnorilsk.19.t:0 "The National Revolution"
twrnorilsk.19.d:0 "The National Bolshevik Revolution is the only path for Russia to go forward. Chairman Brezhnev understands this, the Communist Party understands thism and it is only a matter of time until all of Russia understand this undeniable truth."
twrnorilsk.19.a:0 "Russia will be revived!"

twrnri.1.t:0 "Norilsk Parliament House Completed"
twrnri.1.d:0 "Formerly meeting in a revamped section of a factory, the Norilsk Parliament did not have a proper meeting place, until now.\n\nJust a year ago, the government decided on a permanent location which the parliament would meet, near the center of Norilsk. After months of work, the construction is finally completed. A former Soviet administration building would be entirely reshaped into the Norilsk Parliament House, a building that would be able to host up to 200 deputies. While the Parliament House is barely big enough to be fitted with a parliament hall, the deputies would still need to settle their respective offices in different corners of the city.\n\nFollowing the parliament's completion, many political parties are now pressuring the government, demanding an election, no longer seeing the purpose of the "appointed parliament"."
twrnri.1.a:0 "That's more like it."

twrnri.2.t:0 "5th LRSP Assembly"
twrnri.2.d:0 "The biggest and current ruling party of Yeniseysk, the Liberal Workers Socialist Party has held regular party assemblies, recruiting additional party members and performing multiple political stunts to increase their popularity. Ideologically, the LRSP pledges to uphold democratic values and create a "liberal" approach to socialism, promising things such as protection of personal freedom, a strong government, and workers' rights.\n\nThe party's political views have not changed since its formation by Pavel Frenkel, a man that is determined to reform Yeniseysk into a proper state under the red banner of LRSP. In his fifth party assembly, Frenkel hinted towards an upcoming election, promising the party that, with all the work they have done for the people, their right to rule will finally be proven after a decisive election."
twrnri.2.a:0 ""...then, we will continue our great work!""

twrnri.3.t:0 "Election Planned"
twrnri.3.d:0 "Following the hints at the 5th LRSP Assembly, Pavel Frenkel and his government has announced the plan for an upcoming election, the republic's very first proper general election. In this general election, voters will determine the political makeup of the deputies, and most importantly, which party would be able to lead the government with a mandate given by the people. However, unique to Yeniseysk, the deputies usually hold little to no influence in the government, with their function largely being a rubber stamp for the leading party heading the executive. In addition, in the upcoming days, the Electoral Registry would be opened for political parties, allowing parties that have met the requirements to join the election.\n\nSadly, due to logistical reasons, the election will only take place in Norilsk, with rural representatives voting on behalf of their separate communities."
twrnri.3.a:0 "Finally, a taste of electoralism."

twrnri.4.t:0 "Electoral Registry Opened"
twrnri.4.d:0 "Located next to the newly constructed Norilsk Parliament House, the Electoral Registry is now officially opened. In this two months, political parties that have over 500 registered members and can afford to pay an entrance fee will be registered under an electoral ticket. Coalitions are only allowed on a joint ticket, and parties that have registered a ticket may not submit additional tickets.\n\nAlongside these basic requirements, there are many more absurd rules that political parties have to follow. These rules are laid by the registry to eliminate as many minor, insignificant parties from joining the election as possible.\n\nIn light of what the registry announced, the Norilsk PDR has filed multiple complaints, calling the upcoming election "a total sham"."
twrnri.4.a:0 "One ticket at a time."

twrnri.5.t:0 "LRSP Announces Election Bid"
twrnri.5.d:0 "Delegates of the LRSP have registered their party for the upcoming election. Being the largest party, LRSP was able to finish the process in a relatively quick fashion, paying the fee upfront and meeting little to no challenge.\n\nImmediately after the ticket was confirmed, Pavel Frenkel performed a brief speech, encouraging the people to vote for LRSP in the Republic's first ever general election."
twrnri.5.a:0 "As expected."

twrnri.6.t:0 "KSP-Demokraty Joint Ticket"
twrnri.6.d:0 "Arguably the party with the most political experience, the KSP (Communist Socialist Party) claims to be the successor of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Norilsk. Formed in the Norillag by imprisoned Soviet officials, the Communist Socialist Party despises the multiple different "Soviet" governments. Led by the charismatic leader Leonid Brezhnev, a former Soviet commissar, the Communist Socialist Party continued to grow in size and drifted apart from typical communist views. By the end of 1951, the Communist Socialist Party's ideology has reached its final form: dedication towards accomplishing Marxism by the use of nationalism and traditionalism. Keeping many aspects of the Soviet system while introducing radical rightist ideas.\n\nTherefore, once the upcoming general election was announced, the KSP seeked to register. Wanting to increase their chances, the Communist Socialist Party partnered with the infamous Democratic Sector, a small but relevant political party that openly advocates for Italian style fascism Together, the two parties have successfully launched a joint ticket, being the first opposition group to openly stand against the ruling LRSP."
twrnri.6.a:0 "These people are literal fascists!"

twrnri.7.t:0 "Al'ternativa Announces Election Bid"
twrnri.7.d:0 "Formed by the more "intellectually stimulated" prisoners of the Norillag, the Alternative Communist Party is the self-proclaimed "spiritual successor" of Soviet Union's Left Opposition. Led by the formerly imprisoned Ivan Vrachev, the Alternative Communist Party brands itself as a true "alternative solution" to all of Yeniseysk's problems. Furthermore, the party follows Trotskyism as its guiding principle, seeing Trotskyism as the solution for not only the province, but the whole of Russia in general.\n\nDespite urges from the LRSP to not run in the upcoming general election, the Alternative Communist Party, backed by the intellectuals, have registered for the election, seeking to remove the contradictory LRSP from position of power."
twrnri.7.a:0 "These Trotskyites..."

twrnri.8.t:0 "AP Betrayal"
twrnri.8.d:0 "Commonly known as the Vanguard Party, its formation was tied with the arrival, then defection of the Soviet reinforcements. Originally, the Vanguard Party worked closely with the LRSP, and it remained a party of primarily military interest, bearing an ideology similar to the Bolsheviks. But, leader of the Vanguard Party, Alexander Sirotkin has registered the party for the upcoming general election. But, Sirotkin promised that their party will cooperate with other political parties regardless of election results. Leaders of the LRSP have condemned this political development, stating that it would only serve to split the vote within the "liberal base"."
twrnri.8.a:0 "Those bastards!"

twrnri.9.t:0 "Mob Clashes"
twrnri.9.d:0 "Tensions between the different political parties are tense. In a political stunt, the LRSP organized a small booth in front of their party headquarters, handing out free, small loaves of bread, this event was extremely popular with the locals, with hundreds lining up to receive their shares.\n\nHowever, KSP supporters, equipped with shovels and megaphones, disturbed the event by repeatedly shouting the phrase "LRSP poisoned the bread, only traitors can stomach it". After garnering little to no attention, the KSP escalated their actions by talking directly with the people waiting in the queue, resulting in a violent confrontation between LRSP supporters and KSP supporters. The incident went on for approximately 40 minutes before military police restored order, as a result, two people died and a dozen more were injured. Pavel Frenkel and Leonid Brezhnev both condemned the violence, but blamed one another for being the provocation."
