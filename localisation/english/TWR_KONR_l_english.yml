Combined with Marshal Bunyachenko's masterful reforms within the officer corps and central command, the Russian Liberation Army is undoubtedly the most professional army on this side of the A-A Line."

 ## Leader Descriptions ##

 SERGEI_BUNYACHENKO_DESC:0 "What turns a patriot into a traitor? Some believe it could be out of disillusionment with one's country, while others argue it may be out of pure expediency. Or perhaps it is done staring through the barrel of an enemy's gun? In the case of Sergei Bunyachenko, the truth is shrouded in unknowns. Born in 1902 to a family of poor Ukrainian peasants, his childhood could not have come at a worse time. A teenager when the Bolshevik Revolution broke out, he joined the Red Army to fight the Ukrainian People's Republic. Coming out of the war, he quietly rose through the ranks as Stalin tightened his grip over Soviet life. Shortly after a brief stint of combat against Japanese forces at Lake Khasan, Bunyachenko's drift from Communist life began, as he was expelled from the Party for his open criticism of collectivization. Still, in desperate need when the Germans invaded, Red Army command assigned Bunyachenko command of an infantry division on the Transcaucasian Front, one that was unable to hold for very long.\n\nCaptured by the Wehrmacht in late 1942, he reluctantly joined the newly-emerging Russian Liberation Army, a collaboration force composed primarily of captured Red Army officers and White emigres seeking to settle a score with the Bolsheviks. Having shown his usefulness, the Germans soon rewarded Bunyachenko with command of the Army. After the war ended, he went to work consolidating a new power base within the newly-established Reichskommissariat Moskowien while contending with German administrators that routinely ignored him over their golden boy, Bronislav Kaminski.\n\nWaiting for the perfect opportunity to exact vengeance on his benefactors for abandoning his movement to the partisan wolves, Marshal Bunyachenko wasted no time in declaring his new "National Counter-Revolution" following the death of Adolf Hitler to drive Russia's greatest enemies into the wastes of history. Now in charge of a truly free Russian state in the ruins of post-war central Russia, Sergei Bunyachenko is surrounded by those who wish to see his vision trampled. Be they communist partisan, German Nazi, or the "madmen" within his movement that seek a return to the days before the February Revolution of 1917."
 TSAR_VLADIMIR_DESC:0 "Once and always the son of the man who would become the greatest and most famous pretender to the Russian throne, Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov has now achieved what his father could not and sits at the head of a restored monarchy in Russia. Born and first raised in Finland due to the outbreak of the Russian Revolution, they would soon move to Germany, then to France, where Vladimir spent the remainder of his life up until his invitation to assume the imperial mantle. After the death of his father in 1938, he inherited his title of grand duke and took his place in claiming the imperial title, but in the years that closely followed it would bring him much difficulty. Vladimir had a contentious relationship with the Nazi regime in France, even being placed in a concentration camp at one point after refusing to call for support for the war against the Soviets, although he would later relent to this demand. Taken inland by Germany both for his safety and to ensure Vladimir was kept where he could be seen, Vladimir then spent the remainder of the war in Paris. After the war quieted, the Nazis lost interest in the young grand duke and he was allowed to return to his home on the French coast. Moving to Vladivostok in 1952 in the hopes of organizing a restoratonist movement within the young Republic. When the RNNA successfully took over the government and invited him to become in fact as well as law Tsar of all the Russias, he decided to look at the potential to fulfill his father's dream as a blessing. However, now Vladimir will see just how accurate that view of the situation really is."

 ## Events ##

 rmd.1.t:0 "Holiday In Moskowien"
 rmd.1.d:0 "The revolt in the heart of the Reichskommissariat is going swimmingly, but the anarchy that followed our revolt is a true indicator of the situation in Moskowien. On one hand, there is the entire Wehrmacht force, while the communists also stir trouble elsewhere. Day after day, our enemies are multiplying in number and pose a general danger both to ourselves and to the entire future of the Russian nation.\n\nSurrounded on all sides by those who wish to destroy everything that true Russians hold dear, we must make a most-difficult choice. Do we focus our efforts on defeating the communist Permite rebels, or on the remnants of the dastardly Wehrmacht?"
 rmd.1.a:0 "The godless commmunists must fall!"
 rmd.1.b:0 "Drive the Germans out at all cost!"

 rmd.2.t:0 "Committee Emergency Decree 39:"
 rmd.2.d:0 "Bronislav Kaminski, one of the leading figures in the entire structure of the rotten RONA organization, has turned away from everything that we Russians believe in, deciding to cooperate with the occupier in the fight for liberation. We must not allow the situation to turn in his favor, as evidenced by the capture of several of his sympathizers. Any and all persons found guilty of sympathizing with Bronislav Kaminski and his turncout regiment will be prosecuted to the full extent of military law."
 rmd.2.a:0 "It is either us or them. There are no other choices."

 rmd.3.t:0 "Letter To The Tsar"
 rmd.3.d:0 "To our most beloved and most respected tsar of all Russia, Vladimir:\n\nWe cordially inform you, that the Russian National People's Army, which has resolutely fought for the salvation of the whole of Russia and its people, that upon our decisive military victory, Russia will once again find itself needing a ruler of your prestige. The new Russia will require an autocratic hand to lead her to the future, for the wrongs of 1917 to be undone, and to go side by side, together with us, on a campaign towards the fixing of a broken Russia. We look forward to your answer to our question and sincerely hope for a positive answer from you, Your Majesty.\n\nSincerely, Sergey Ivanov"
 rmd.3.a:0 "For now, only time is the answer."

 rmd.4.t:0 "The Guns Fall Silent"
 rmd.4.d:0 "Against all odds, The Russian people have stood up against the communist devils and the totalitarian Germans. While many see us as mere turncoats that worked with the late Adolf Hitler, many appear to just be thankful that the years of partisan warfare and second-class treatment at the hands of the Nazis are finally over. Our job however is far from over, as many within our army and government are not yet fully on-board with Marshal Bunyachenko's vision."
 rmd.4.a:0 "Forward."

 rmd.5.t:0 "Officers Suspected AWOL"
 rmd.5.d:0 "Sitting in their office, the division commanders flipped through the names of their officers, sergeants, colonels, but also soldiers, after the successful revolt that brought their faction to power. Now, they are left with the reorganization of the state.\n\nLooking at the paper, the first commander said briefly, "Did you notice anything strange about these officers?" pointing to several names. "Is there a problem?" The question of another commander followed, who drank as part of the victory. Passing the bottle to the third and last commander. "Are ... those ..." He began to hiccup from getting drunk. "... monarchists?" He managed to finish the sentence, while the first commander nodded, pumping doubts to the third commander about their loyalty. "Have they made any trouble so far?" "I don't think so, I'd even say they fought well, but soon after the revolt, like they decided not to follow any orders?" The other commander thought about it, he began to search for possible scenarios that were running through his head. "Do you think what I think?"\n\n"What are you talking about?" Suddenly, the first commander, unprepared for this question, grabbed his glass and slowly took a sip. "Monarchists are a very strange kind of people, especially when armed, do you think they are preparing for something drastic?" "You don't think that ...""
 rmd.5.a:0 ""...they are planning something big?""

 rmd.6.t:0 "Mutiny Imminent!"
 rmd.6.d:0 "Running through the halls of the central command, the officer who was ordered to inform his superiors as soon as possible, carrying a report confirming the earlier suspicion that mass desertion was being prepared in RNNA monarchist circles, a threat to even remove Sergei Bunyachenko from the current government. He didn't even have time to knock on the door, when he burst into the office, frightening everyone inside.\n\n "What's this about? What's the reason for this intrusion?" His superior asked angrily, but the officer did not have time to think about it but handed the report over to him. "What is this?" “Desertion within monarchist circles,” he said wearily, trying to catch his breath. Reading carefully, he re-read it again and again too see if it was actually true. He crumpled the report angrily and threw it in the bin, running his hands nervously over his face, thinking about what to do at the moment. "What just happened?" He was asked by a man with whom he had talked until recently about the victory that followed the revolt. "We have a problem." He said briefly, grabbing the phone next to him. "What are you looking at me for? Speak." "What do I say when I don't have all the necessary information?" "Fuckin' monarchists are threatening to secede from our army and launch a new coup, DAMN IT!" He didn't have time to think, the phone call was certainly already alarming others in the army. "Hello, Central Command?" "Yes. We just got a report on the RNNA ranks and it's extremely worrying." "Can we solve this situation somehow?""
 rmd.6.a:0 "Send every man you have, and put them in jail!"
 rmd.6.b:0 "Ivanov had an agreement with us, stand down!"

 rmd.7.t:0 "RNNA Coup Foiled!"
 rmd.7.d:0 ""Hold them!" The soldier shouted as the last deserters of the RNNA fled their barracks. Falling them to the ground with a rain of bullets, they grabbed them by the necks, while bloody traces remained behind them. They were thrown in front of a crowd and were beaten beyond recognition. The soldiers lined them up after they determined that the last officer, as well as the soldier, had been caught, nailing them to the wall and turning their faces towards them. "Is all of this shit tallied?" The officer, who led this mass arrest, asked.\n\n"Yes, there shouldn't be that many of them in the city. Moreover, we managed to catch a few of their leaders." "How many?" "Four. We sent the rest we caught in the middle of town to jail, so we'll see what happens to them later." During the conversation, the officer signaled to his soldiers to prepare their weapons. "Execution?" "No. I'll caress them in the middle of the street." Without further ado, he lined up the soldiers in a line and told them briefly, "When I say fire, shoot!" And in almost a split second, lead filled the bodies of RNNA members, and they all fell to the ground, drowning in the blood that remained on the ground."
 rmd.7.a:0 "And with this, the last thorn in Bunyachenko's side was removed."

 rmd.8.t:0 "RNNA Coup Successful!"
 rmd.8.d:0 ""We address all residents of Moscow, we have stormed the central command of the High Command and arrested all the traitors of the Russian nation. The time of republicanism is now over and we can begin anew. The first formal act after our takeover will of course be the stabilization of Moscow, and then the pacification of all the territories currently under our control. After that, we will turn to further stabilization of our country by returning to the old Russian traditions, traditions that have accompanied us for centuries.\n\nMartial law will be introduced from today until the end of the state of emergency and we ask all citizens of Moscow to abide by these rules. This is the RNNA Command Staff, signing off.""
 rmd.8.a:0 "And now it's time to go back to our roots..."

 rmd.9.t:0 "The First Russian Liberation Committee Congress"
 rmd.9.d:0 "As we move forward with reconstruction and look forward towards reunification, the lingering issue of constitutionalism pressed by Miletiy Zykov has forced us to consider the future of the Russian Liberation Movement. To address these pressing issues, we will host the Russian Liberation Committee's first ever congress as leaders of an independent nation.\n\nAs representatives from across our vast territories congregate in the Kremlin, vestiges of the Germans there have been haphazardly torn down making the chambers appear ransacked. As everyone gathers in the old Kremlin Presidium for what will ultimately determine the future of the party, the atmosphere remains extremely optimistic."
 rmd.9.a:0 "For a free Russia!"

 rmd.10.t:0 "Bunyachenko Opens The Congress"
 rmd.10.d:0 "President Bunyachenko was the first to take the stage of the congress to much fanfare, stressing the need for party unity in the face of greater threats in the west and east.\n\nContinuing his opening speech, Bunyachenko spoke of his idealistic vision of a new Russia unhampered by the constraints of liberalism, communism and fascism. A Russia that both embraced its roots but also looked forwards towards the future."
 rmd.10.a:0 "And everybody clapped."

 rmd.11.t:0 "The Legacy Of The Whites"
 rmd.11.d:0 "Many of the men and women in our ranks identify as white Russians, a blanket term for anticommunist Russians following the Russian Revolution of 1917. The Whites were, however, extremely divided politically. When the far-eastern Russian Republic was founded, many liberal-leaning Whites and generals from Manchuria flocked to its ranks instead of joining us. They now sit as a rival government, mocking our rulers as authoritarian German lapdogs and as traitors.\n\nWe can choose to denounce them likewise as American puppets weakened by liberal democracy, but for the sake of reconciliation and even possible peaceful reunification reaching out to the Vladivostok government may save us the resources and lives needed for military conquest."
 rmd.11.a:0 "They are too far gone."
 rmd.11.b:0 "They are our comrades against communism."

 rmd.12.t:0 "Priorities Of Reunification"
 rmd.12.d:0 "We are the legitimate government of the Russian people, and there is no doubt that Russian reunification is our number one priority. The KONR is, however, divided on where we should priortize.\n\nBunyachenko and his supporters see the Perm government and the east's vast resources as our priority. They also argue the importance for ideological reasons, as the vanquishing of communism now is important for the nation's restructuring. Others however believe that prioritizing our neighbours to the south in Ukraine and the Caucasus would bolster our strength further in our eventual war with both the communists and nazis."
 rmd.12.a:0 "The Perm Presidium must burn!"
 rmd.12.b:0 "Ukraine and the Caucasus are more important."

 rmd.13.t:0 "The Status Of Russian Democracy"
 rmd.13.d:0 "Russia has not had a long history of democracy, however this doesn't mean it can't change. Miletiy Zykov and his constitutionalist support base have long argued that the new Russia open towards more politically-liberal reforms to gain support from the Toronto Accord and to further stabilize the new Russia.\n\nBunyachenko's allies struck back hard against this proposal, saying such a move would cause Russia to degrade into the political instability that plagued Russia in 1917 and the far-eastern Republic in 1951. As the voting on the congress's final resolution was finished, the results showed an overwhelming support for..."
 rmd.13.a:0 "We can't risk it."
 rmd.13.b:0 "We need democracy...now!"

 rmd.14.t:0 "The New KONR Proposal"
 rmd.14.d:0 "As the first Russian Liberation Committee Congress comes to an end, Bunyachenko must now sign off on the new directives for the [RMD.GetName]'s new priorities. As he poured over everything mentioned in the congress and which ways everybody leaned he made his decision."
 rmd.14.a:0 "The conservative model would be adopted."
 rmd.14.b:0 "Zykov's propoal would be adopted."

 rmd.15.t:0 "The New Russian Constitution"
 rmd.15.d:0 "There was much celebration in Moscow today as the new constitution was officially signed into law. Promising vast freedoms in speech, assembly and religious expression, committed liberals hail the move as a major step towards democracy in Russia. As now-legal opposition parties quickly organize themselves for an imminent election, Zykov has been going up and down our battered nation encouraging people to participate in government affairs.\n\nBunyachenko is, however, displeased with the recent developments. An election that doesn't go his way would potentially see his work held back by governmental trappings of "discourse" and "debate", possibly even destroy the idea of reunification itself. Realizing this, he picked up the phone and called his allies in the state police."
 rmd.15.a:0 ""There may be a job for you in a month.""

 rmd.16.t:0 "The [GetYear] Elections"
 rmd.16.d:0 "As the Russian people went to the polls today, the atmosphere was practically electric. Not since 1917 had the people been allowed to vote in an election that actually mattered. As it turned out though, this one would not matter either.\n\nSome people suspected counters of throwing away thousands of ballots at a time, while state police harassed opposition politicans for overt criticism of Bunyachenko. As the results finally came in, the truth of this election was as bright as day:"
 rmd.16.a:0 "KONR wins with over 96.8% of the vote."

 rmd.17.t:0 "The New Russian Constitution"
 rmd.17.d:0 "As the new Russian constitution was signed today, there was little in the ways of freedom or liberty on the agenda. The president of the republic, still Sergei Bunyachenko, would have far-reaching executive powers allowing him to effectively govern for life.\n\nWhile there were scattered protests across the country railing against the allegedly shallow constitution, they were quickly broken up by local army detachments."
 rmd.17.a:0 "A new age for Russia has begun."

 rmd.19.t:0 "Bunyachenko's Forces Reunite Russia"
 rmd.19.d:0 "As the climatic Russian warlord era finally comes to an end, it would appear that Sergei Bunyachenko's [RMD.GetName] has finally reunited Russia from Moscow to Vladivostok. Once a mere collaborating general for the Germans, he broke with the Nazis almost immediately after Adolf Hitler died, sending his professional army across the Russian wastes. Opposition to his regime ranging from across the political spectrum are reportedly being rounded up and arrested.\n\nThe new regime, while not explicitly anti-Western, has expressed limited enthusiasm in joining the international community, focusing instead of reuniting the rest of Russia and rebuilding the broken nation internally."
 rmd.19.a:0 "A new Russia rises!"
 rmd.19.b:0 "Have Russia's greatest traitors been vindicated?"

 rnna.1.t:0 "Return Of The Zemsky Sobor"
 rnna.1.d:0 "As we move further towards Tsarist restoration, it's time we brought back some of the old institutions of the Russian Empire, most notably the Zemsky Sobor. An old legislative body dating back to Ivan The Terrible in the 16th Century, the Tsars had always come to rely on the Zemsky Sobor for advice from their nobles and clergy for the decision-making of the empire. As we seek to make the old system work in the modern era, it will have to change.\n\nThe new Tsar will have little in the ways of actual authority over his vast realm, leaving RNNA officials to govern on his behalf. The Tsar will still be required to sign new laws into effect, however there is nothing to stop Ivanov or his allies from forcing him to do it despite any objectionns the Tsar might have. The Sobor, therefore, will act on the Tsar's wishes, however vague it may be or however it may be interpreted."
 rnna.1.a:0 "Excellent!"

 rnna.2.t:0 "The New Constitution"
 rnna.2.d:0 "As we transition from a group of officers ruling over Russia into a genuine nation-state, a proper constitution outlining the definition of our state and its fundamental principles will have to be codified. The new constitution, largely a useless document, shall define the future Russian Empire as a constitutional monarchy ruled by a Tsar and the Zemsky Sobor technically underneath him.\n\nSome have noted that the constitution has little in the ways of guaranteeing free speech or opposition, but it was a necessary sacrifice for the sake of Russia."
 rnna.2.a:0 "That should shut the liberals up."

 rnna.3.t:0 "Return Of The Old"
 rnna.3.d:0 "It was a cold day in Moscow; But in spite of the weather, Russians from across the realm gathered in Red Square to witness something they hadn't seen in almost a century: the coronation of their head of state as Tsar of all Russias. As Vladimir I made his precession through the square in a horse-drawn carriage, cavalry belonging to the RNNA flanked him from all sides. While some cheered the new Tsar, many others seemed more intently curious as to what such a move would bring.\n\nEntering the partially-restored Dormition Cathedral, hunderds of RNNA officials and foreign representatives sat dutifully before rising from their seats clapping as the new Tsar entered the chambers. The ceremony was long and drawn-out as was tradition, with the exiled Patriarch, who had recently returned to Moscow conducting it. As the elaborate crown was placed on Tsar Vladimir's head, a 21 cannon salute broke out across the Kremlin as the chamber broke out in chorous singing "God Save The Tsar".\n\nAs the newly crowned Tsar exited the cathedral, a massive crowd had gathered to sing their praises of the new Tsar, throwing him bouquets of flowers. All through the night, the people partied in the streets of Moscow and across the new Empire, as the food and vodka started flowing once again.\n\nMonarchism in Russia, as it seems, never died."
 rnna.3.a:0 "Three cheers for the new Tsar!"
 
 rnna.4.t:0 "Restoration Of The Russian Empire"
 rnna.4.d:0 "Today has been marked by shocking reports from Russia, as Sergey Bunyachenko's government has been overthrown in a violent and bloody coup d'etat by young military officers. These officers are members of an organization known as the RNNA, and led by one Sergey Ivanov. Though much about the situation remains unclear, Ivanov has made the monarchist sympathies of the RNNA known, and Duke Vladimir Romanov has been invited to return to Russia from his residence in Vladivostok and take the throne as Tsar. However, there are also signs of extreme measures being taken by the RNNA, such as the extrajudicial execution of many of the members of Bunyachenko's KONR and discussion of imposing harsher restrictions on political freedom, in a reflection of some of the ugliest of Russian nationalism."
 rnna.4.a:0 "What is this, an alternate history novel?"

 rnna.5.t:0 "The Tsar's Men"
 rnna.5.d:0 "An empire cannot be run alone, especially one as vast as Russia. To govern effectively and fairly, the Tsar has approved the members of his cabinet to help him govern. Of all the groups in Russia that would be willing to help him are the generals and idealogues of the Russian People's Liberation Army.\n\nDespite their extremist tendencies, they are fanatically loyal to the Tsar in all aspects and seem willing to help him govern his new state.\n\nThis crack-team of loyalists may just be what the Russian people need after years of misery at the hands of Nazism and Communism."
 rnna.5.a:0 "Well then, let's get to work!"

 rnna.6.t:0 "The Return Of The Patriarch"
 rnna.6.d:0 "In a move expected by all, the Patriarch of Moscow Alexy I has returned to his position of Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church. As an elaborate ceremony and feast was held in his honour by the Tsar, Alexy has vowed to bring the Russian people back towards the spiritual consciousness they once enjoyed under the old empire.\n\n"The atheist Bolsheviks," he says "had damaged the spirituality of the Russian nation in ways that cannot be described." His message appears to have resonated deeply with the people, and religious institutions across the empire appear delighted to preach doctrine that was once banned by Stalin years ago."
 rnna.6.a:0 "In the name of the father..."

 rnna.7.t:0 "The End Of Secularism"
 rnna.7.d:0 "The secular and borderline atheistic nature of the Soviet Union and German Reich have for years corrupted the Russian people, threatening them with eternal damnation at gunpoint. The new Russia must not repeat these mistakes. Russia has been and always will be a devoutly-Christian nation. All atheist saboteurs and heretical reactonaries best beware when the wrath of the Lord judges them, once they meet their end at a barrel of a gun of course."
 rnna.7.a:0 "S'nami Bog!"

 rnna.8.t:0 "The Tsardom's Torn Legacy"
 rnna.8.d:0 "The Russian Empire did not end on good terms. After the 1905 and 1917 Revolutions, the people had rejected the Tsar and Tsardom due to Nicholas II's absolutist rule and poor decision-making during the First World War. In [GetYear], this attitude of apathy or distaste for the monarchy has not changed much and this has to change.\n\nVladimir is not like his distant relative Nicholas, and will not make the same sort of mistakes as he did. The Tsar's image must be improved no matter the cost, and he seems more than willing to fill this role."
 rnna.8.a:0 "We need a Tsar of the people, now more than ever."

 rnna.9.t:0 "Sakharov and Falangism"
 rnna.9.d:0 "Igor Sakharov is a very accomplisshed man, having come from a noble background yet still fighting dutifully against the communist menace. During his time in the Spanish Civil War, he had joined the Falangist Party under Francisco Franco and learned much about his methods and ideology. The principles of Falangism, he argues, are precisely what Russia needs as it recovers from the occupation's economic collapse just as Spain has been able to recover from its own.\n\nAlthough it seems almost heretical for yet another foreign philosophy to dominate Russian society, however class collaboration and economic centralization not hampered by failed Marxist teachings have proven to work in the past.\n\nSurely, they will work now."
 rnna.9.a:0 "For a syncreticist Russia!"

 rnna.11.t:0 "The Return Of The Russian Empire"
 rnna.11.d:0 "In what seemed like an impossible feat worthy of the history books, the Russian Empire, restored under the leadership of Tsar Vladimir I, has vanquished the last of Russia's warlord contenders and reunified the troubled nation.\n\nAn overtly totalitarian regime, the new Russian Empire is now dominated by ultranationalistic Russians following the principles of Falangism. The Toronto Accord was quick to denounce the new government as being worse even than the Soviet Bolsheviks, but the Russian Empire's territorial and geopolitical ambitions appear to be unphased."
 rnna.11.a:0 "Bozhe Tsarya khrani!"
 rnna.11.b:0 "Deeply disturbing."

 royaltour.1.t:0 "A Drive Through Moscow"
 royaltour.1.d:0 "The Tsar's tour had commenced, hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens in the ancient city of Moscow saluted the Russian monarch as his car, accompanied by soldiers in motorcycles, drove down Tverskaya street. The monarch waved back at his people, with as happy of a smile as one could have; the chants and cheers of his subjects were like music to Vladimir's heart. As the Tsar's parade entered Tverskoy district, fewer and fewer people were seen,the streets were getting emptier as they drove deeper into the historic region of the city. Eventually, the car's roof was put back in place, there were too few people to cheer for.\n\n"Igor" Vladimir called for his chauffeur "i want to greet my people in a more...personal way, park the car" Igor panicked silently for a few seconds, before looking at the cloud-covered sky from the driver's window "I'm sorry, your majesty, that is not in our itinerary, besides, it is going to start raining soon" The tsar raised an eyebrow, suspecting an excuse from his driver "So? It's water, not acid, i will just bring an umbrella" "The tour is going to be very long, your majesty, it would be unfortunate if you fell ill at the start"\n\nRealizing he wouldn't get anywhere, Vladimir sighed, shutting the conversation, and turning his head to the window, as the little rain droplets smashed against it. "Where are we going next?""
 royaltour.1.a:0 "Bolshoi Theatre, your majesty."

 royaltour.2.t:0 "A Most Pious Tsar"
 royaltour.2.d:0 "The tsar stood on a podium, before an audience of thousands in Petrograd, eagerly listening to his speech; behind him, the Church of the Saviour on Spilled Blood, covered in blankets and scaffolding, signs of a very clear restoration process "..i can rest easy knowing the laborers working in the restoration of the Church of the Saviour on Blood do it with the passion every russian man would have when doing a deed of God" An immense wave of claps followed, the monarch stepped off the podium, concluding the act proper.\n\nWhile his guards escorted him away from the crowd, Vladimir reached for one of his advisors, turning at the battered building, then looking back at him "Say, what is the budget for the restoration?" "Umh.." the young man, an accountant and close advisor of the Tsar, read through a paper on the restoration's numbers "10 million rubles, your majesty" "Only 10?" The emperor rubbed his chin for a few seconds, thinking of a better number, this devastated piece of Russian history deserved better. "That is not enough, raise it to 20" "Your majesty, i wouldn't recommend you taking these kinds of decisions in one go-" The accountant read through his paper, with a somewhat nervous look "It's an important piece of Petrograd's history, it must have proper funding" "L-let me t-take care of this, your majesty, i will make sure this project is properly funded" "Ugh.." the tsar silently groaned, in an uncaring disappointment.\n\nOne of the guards opened the door of the car for Vladimir, he waved back at the huge crowd of people one last time, before getting inside of the automobile. The motorcade of the emperor sped away, the Russian monarch sat back as the cheers of the people became more and more distant."
 royaltour.2.a:0 "That church deserves better..."

 royaltour.3.t:0 "A Day In Kiev"
 royaltour.3.d:0 "It was a cold, cloudy afternoon in the city of Kiev, the Tsar and his Prime Minister were to attend the Opera House of Kiev, as a sign of support for the reactivation of cultural activities in the Empire. Today's function was the Tale of Tsar Saltan, by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. The Emperor and Prime Minister Ivanov would sit in the box-seat of the 3rd floor. The Prime Minister was delighted by the performance, the music, the actors, and the melody of those lyrical voices. The Tsar was less impressed, infact, he was dying for some fresh air, he had been touring building after building, barely being able to get a glimpse of the wind. "I need to take a break, i will go for some fresh air, care to join me?" "Your majesty, this is too beautiful to even lose a minute on, i'm sorry, but you will have to go alone" The Tsar got up from his seat and walked off, went downstairs, passing a few uncaring guards, and into the door outside.\n\nHaving a smell of fresh air filling his lungs was a relieving experience. Vladimir decided it would be a perfect chance to stretch his legs and take a walk, it's not like they would miss the emperor. He walked down a few streets, eventually getting lost in the beauty of the ancient city. Despite all the war, tragedy and death that razed Kiev so many times throughout history, it managed to maintain its beauty almost intact. "Flowers! Flowers!" Shouted an old lady, pushing a small cart full of bouquets with her. Vladimir smiled at the sight of a vendor, ever since he left Vladivostok, he was pretty much not allowed to walk on the streets, he was the Tsar, after all. "How much for a bouquet, lady?" "20 kopeks for a flower, 1 ruble for a bouquet" The old woman was clearly blind, she did not notice who she was talking to, her blank pupils stared at the place the voice was coming from. "Have 5, keep the change" Vladimir reached for his pocket, taking out a 5 ruble bill, one of those that had his face printed on them, and handed it to the lady.\n\n"Oh Thank you, young man, here-" the woman picked up a bouquet of lilies for the man. "Thank you" The emperor walked away, with a fresh bouquet of lilies on his hand. Eventually, he found his way back into the Opera House; a worried Ivanov to meet him "Your majesty!" The Prime minister shouted from the entrance of the theater "We thought you got lost!" "Oh,no, I didn't get lost, did the function finish?" "Yes, your majesty"."
 royaltour.3.a:0 "Great!"

 royaltour.4.t:0 "The Parade"
 royaltour.4.d:0 "The emperor and his parade marched through the streets of the Siberian city, there were little preparations this time, this one would be the shortest of his visits, that meant no barriers, no barricades, and less guards than usual. The emperor got what he had desired for a very long time: to greet his subjects in a close, personal way. "Your majesty, you can't say Siberia doesn't love you" said one of the Tsar's advisors who walked along the parade. "No, you certainly can't" Vladimir answered with a wide smile; some could say, he hadn't put such an honest smile in a long, long time. His smile disappeared as one of his guards pushed him to the ground, several gunshots were heard as crowds of people screamed and ran away in panic.\n\n"Fuck the Tsar! death to the fascists!" Battle cries like this one and similar were heard as the gunfight between terrorists and imperial guards began. Eventually, after almost a full minute of fighting in the streets, the last assassin fell to the ground, covered in his own blood. "Your majesty, are you alright?" Asked the guard covering him, still looking to all sides "Yes, yes, let me stand up" The Tsar shook his head and wiped the dirt off his suit, some debris on him was probably better than a bullet to the chest. While the guards were still pondering on the attack, the emperor managed to sneak into the area where the corpses of the perpetrators lay. He looked to both sides, before slipping into one of the dead terrorists pokets, he wanted to know, who were the men that tried tor murder him? He took out the old, dirty passport of the now-corpse\n\n"Igor Orlovich Orlov, age 35, born in Novosibirsk...""
 royaltour.4.a:0 "What a disgrace."

 royaltour.5.t:0 "The Workers Of Vladivostok"
 royaltour.5.d:0 "Vladivostok is one of the cities ongoing heavy reconstruction, the old Russian Port was battered by the constant, endless wars of this century. The Tsar, this time together with his prime minister, would be talking personally to the construction workers of several building sites in the far eastern city, all closely documented by state media to use as a positive piece of propaganda. The workers would bow down before the emperor, prior to being asked several questions by the interested monarch First one on the line was a young man, he seemed to be quite nervous, he bowed to the Tsar and stretched the hand of prime minister Ivanov.\n\n"What is your name?" "Anastasy Kovalyov, your majesty" "How old are you?" "22, your majesty" All of these small interviews were being recorded by an enormous camera crew, this would make a fine piece of propaganda for reconstruction efforts. Another man bowed down before the Emperor, and shook the hand of Prime Minister Ivanov; opposite to the last one, he was a gigantic man. "What is your name?" "Pyotr Vasnetsov, your majesty, 48" Vladimir smiled at the sight of his subjects, the emperor didn't get to greet his people in such a close way "Boris Zhigunov, 34" "Pavel Fedotov, 28" "Anatoly Shchekochikhin, 36" "Edik Sabitov, 61"\n\nThe Tsar found himself in a state of joy he hadn't felt in a long, long time. To be able to talk with normal, everyday people was a luxury for a monarch. It would all end with the Emperor taking a shot of vodka with his subjects. The Tsar raised his glass, followed by others, and gulped down the shot. "Aaand Cut!" The cameraman shouted; the filming crew began packing up. The construction workers gave one final bow to the Tsar before his prime minister approached him "Your majesty, it is time we leave, we have more places to tour" "I've only talked to a handful of the workers in this site, it would be impolite to not greet them all" "Your majesty, with all respect.." Prime Minister Ivanov got closer to the emperor, whispering to his ear "This place is unregal for a monarch" Vladimir stared at the Prime minister, didn't say a word, he only stared in a mild anger "Your motorcade is ready, your majesty.""
