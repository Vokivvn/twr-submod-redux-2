As independence movements gather steam and threaten to turn increasingly violent across the colonies, a larger and larger proportional of the British people and politicians are calling for a process of 'decolonisation' - the end of Empire and the setting up of newly independent states across Africa and Asia. \nHowever, some still insist that although the imperial system needs reform to make it not only more effective but more just to its subjects, the Empire must be maintained at all costs to keep Britain's place in the world and hold firm against the Nazi threat. \n§RWarning - The choice made here will have a significant impact on events later in the game.§!"

    twrbritainflavour.0.d:0 "To say that the last decade and a half has been a disaster for Britain and the world would be no exaggeration. It stunned the world when German panzers blitzed through the Ardennes, encircled the allied forces in Belgium and caused the rapid collapse of France. Britain was defended by her navy and the Channel, but all could see that with Britain alone, her army lost, and Nazi jackboots marching across Europe, little hope of success remained. A bitter armistice was soon signed, maintaining the status quo between the Axis powers and the United Kingdom, though allowing continued Italian occupation of British Somaliland.\n\nThe humiliation of 1940 proved to be disastrous to the UK's global standing. Imperial subjects questioned the power of the British Empire, especially as Japanese forces seized large tracts of colonial territory in the Far East. Though victory against Japan came through cooperation with the United States, the damage was done. Unrest broke out and rapidly escalated across India, forcing a humiliatingly rapid transfer of power and withdrawal of British forces, as British authority across what remains of the Empire wavers. All the while, as the world watched in horror as the Wehrmacht butchered its way across the Soviet Union, German forces stood only 20 miles away, with only a fragile armistice holding them back. The ruling Conservative government, having already forced out Churchill after the disaster at Dunkirk, was voted out in the wake of its humiliating defeats and replaced by Labour under Clement Attlee.\n\nToday, Britain remains the scared but stalwart final frontier-bastion of freedom in Europe. The trans-Atlantic Toronto Accord alliance gives Britain valuable allies as the United States takes up the torch of the leading defender of democracy, and her still impressive navy guards the seas, but barbed wire still lines the beaches and conscription remains enforced for the foreseeable future. With Nazi Germany and its grand European Empire seeing signs of serious instability, the possibility of a return to active hostilities seems increasingly likely. Britain, though battered, is ready."

Its people, however, are still proud of their city, as they clamber onto double-decker buses or down into the underground tunnels to make their way to work every day.

One of the shortest serving prime ministers, Mr. Churchill served in office from May to July 1940, when he was soon ousted by his cabinet and parliament in favour of Edward Wood, his rival for leadership only months before. A prominent critic of the Chamberlain and Baldwin government's appeasement policies, it was this that marked him out as the best candidate to lead Britain in war with Germany. However, his legacy has been tainted by the disaster of Dunkirk, as the war went on. It was his active refusal for a peace negotiation that would ultimately doom him. Even before his premiership, Churchill's name has been associated with failures such as Gallipoli, Tonypandy and the gold standard. Post-premiership, Churchill remained a staunch defender of his wartime record, a constant critic of the government he once led, stirring up controversy in the House of Commons. While Churchill was certainly the driving force of many wartime decisions, whether he was solely to blame remains an issue of fierce debate. Perhaps history could have went another way? We cannot know for certain. \n\nNot long after resigning, Churchill stated of the peace with Germany - "Britain has ended her role in the world, now the eyes turn to the powers of Communism and Nazism. While alike as two of the worst tyrannies of the world, only one can truly dominate, and no matter the result Europe shall recede into darkness. Be it Hitler or Stalin. This is the price we have payed, the British Empire." After the fall of the Soviet Union, he would continue to be a fierce war-hawk against Nazi Germany, declaring the destruction of its tyranny to be a necessity.\n\nOne of the most controversial Prime Ministers in history, Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill will take his rest in a private funeral in Bladon, Oxfordshire."

He would later be one of the prominent advocates for an anti-appeasement 'Popular Front' leading to many attacks from within his own party. However, very few can deny the effect he has had not only on history, but the future of this country.\n\nA private funeral for family and friends shall be held in Croesyceiliog.

Conceived by journalist Dennis Bardens, Panaroma is set to be released by the BBC every two weeks, and will feature its host, journalist Max Robertson, reporting on topics ranging from the arts and celebrity to the news at home and abroad.\n\nThe heads of the BBC understand that their new show is bristling with the potential to kick off and make its mark worldwide as a place of serious debate and investigative journalism, something desperately needed in these tumultuous and challenging times."

    twrbritainflavour.19.d:0 "At last, the animated film adaptation of George Orwell's famous novel, 'Animal Farm', has been released in the UK! A British-American collaboration, Animal Farm takes the honour of being the first feature-length British animation to receive a formal cinema release.\n\nThe original 1945 allegorical novella depicts an animal revolution against their human farmer oppressors, directly reflecting the events of the Russian Revolution and the rise of Stalinism and Beriaism. The murderous pig Napoleon, as well as his fawning sycophant Pinkeye, seize total control and execute their animal opponents. The novella concludes with the invasion of the farm by the fanatical Mr Frederick and his violent farmers, who take the land for themselves and drive the animals away. The story ends on a bittersweet note: while Napoleon is left behind to die, a New Farm is established by Pinkeye who continues his predecessor's reign of terror.\n\nThe film has been criticised for differing from its source material, as greater emphasis has been placed on Mr Frederick's atrocities against the animals, and emphasising more on how the greed of the 'animals' led to division, paranoia and weakness against the much greater and more evil threat. Some critics argue that this distracts from Orwell's original goal, which was, in a post-Barbarossa academic environment that sympathised with the Soviet Union and focused largely on the evil of the Nazis, an attempt to shine a spotlight on the continuing tyranny of the Soviet Union."

Kowloon was put under curfew and the military was summoned to assist local police forces in putting down the riots. 75 civilians died from the violent riots, at least 1,000 more civilians and law enforcers were injured in what could be described as a three faction conflict between Nationalists, Communists, and the Colonial Government.\n\nRepublic of China has issued a warning to the Hong Kong Government, demanding that Communist unrest must be suppressed as soon as possible in order to protect the local population."

After years on the back foot, cowering behind the channel and dreading the day Hitler reneged on the 1940 Armistice, Britain has regained its footing and military prowess and is ready to yet again go on the offensive. The lessons of this military disaster, and other experiences of modern warfare, have been learned and learned well. Innovation and investment has transformed the British armed forces into a fighting force far more fit for the modern age than it ever was, and now, British military planners are much more confident in the ability of their resources.

Now, with hard work, new economic policy, and a bit of luck, the engine of the British economy has sputtered back to life, increasing economic output and, in turn, allowing a period of prosperity for the people.

The disaster and Dunkirk, where most of the British Expeditionary Force fell into captivity after encirclement, haunts the army to this day. Beyond that, Britain's land forces have a lack of experience, having only taken part in a relatively small capacity in the war against Japan compared to their American allies. However, while the ground forces have never traditionally been the core of the British armed forces, necessity has expanded them. Conscription remains in place and the army remains on alert in case the delicate Anglo-German armistice is broken and invasion happens. To turn the British army into a modern, effective fighting force, though - something badly needed as another war in Europe looks more likely - will take time, effort and resources."

Britain's once invincible naval prestige, too, is damaged, with a lacklustre performance in the early stages of the Pacific War being only partially rectified by later more successful join action with the United States against Japan. Of course, Britain's navy is still very large, more than enough to guard the channel and its shores and make any German invasion very, very difficult, but many of its ships are old, and the fleet as a whole is in need of reform and modernisation. True naval conflict with Germany, more than the minor skirmishes of 1939-1940, will require Britain to thoroughly prepare its fleet, so that, with her allies, she can rule the waves once again."

However, it is key to both Britain's defence and her power projection against any future action in Europe, and must be bolstered.

It was only inevitable, then, that Britain's largest colonial possession would soon after the war break free, parts of its army mutineeing and its people resisting both peacefully and violently. Britain was forced to rapidly withdraw from a collapsing India, quickly signing deals with the Delhi government of the Indian Republic and with Pakistan. Yet though Delhi claims ownership across most of the subcontinent, to this day the collapse of British rule leaves scars in the form of division and breakaway states, still fighting for control. As we go forward into this new post-colonial age, we must continue to assert ourselves in the 'lost' subcontinent.

But something is different today... the taste of the air, the attitudes of the average person on the streets, something is certainly brewing; something the people of London would soon find out.\n\nWhat had started as a now-regular demonstration in Trafalgar Square swelled in size exponentially. Although the original organizers were members of the CPGB, regular citizens began joining in, changing slogans like "Mosley Must Go!" and "It shall not happen here!". Police had been called on the scene to make sure this demonstration of freedom of assembly not turn violent, but then the unthinkable happened; the protestors began moving towards the Palace of Westminster, demanding the Union government resign.\n\n"I've just received word from Westminster security" said Constable Thomas. "We are not to disperse the crowd unless they attempt to trespass." Thomas was new to the Police Force, having only graduated from the academy a month ago. Standing defiantly in front of the palace gates, he couldn't help but feel nervous. He was an eyewitness to the Battle of Cable Street as a young boy, and the experience of witnessing such violence first-hand had actually inspired him into joining the police force, but now it looked like he was gonna experience it all over again. This time, as a combatant. Fortunately, the protestors stopped just in front of him as their numbers continued to grow. Then out of nowhere, a truck filled with blackshirts arrived. Almost immediately, violence broke out between the mob and blackshirts. "Here we go..." Thomas said to himself. After hours of attempting to bring order to the violence just outside Britain's symbol of democracy, local news stations flurried with reports. "Blood fills the streets outside Westminster!" reads one headline. "Attempted anti-fascist putsch crushed!" cries another. All in all, 87 are arrested, 102 are sent to the hospital with serious injuries from police batons and fists alike, and tragically 10 lie dead.\n\nComing home later that day, Thomas hangs his police cap on the dresser and changes out of his uniform. He had received multiple bruises and a bloody nose from the encounter, but at least he did his duty to protect and serve the people, or so he now told himself.

Once Craig exhausted his ammunition, he jumped from the roof where he fractured his spine. \nBoth Bentley and Craig were charged with murder, but only Bentley has received the death penalty, due to Craig's minor status.

Two main choices are available for Attlee. \n\nAndrew Bevan represents the left wing of the party, an 'Old Left' proponent of democratic socialism. \n\nHugh Gaitskell is the current Chancellor, and the other option for the new cabinet. In contrast to Bevan, Gaitskell, on the right wing of the party, is eager to move the party away from its old explicitly socialist roots, and reform the party's drive away from nationalisation."

    twrbritainpolitics.19.d:0 "With the recent construction of Britain's first nuclear weapons, the question has arisen on how to approach our nuclear policy. Most of the country sees the threat Nazi Germany poses, and that a British nuclear arsenal is the perfect deterrent to avoid a potential German preemtive attack or invasion. Some go further, and push for a program of rapid construction of a large nuclear arsenal to act as a proper deterrent.\n\nHowever, some more pacificist parts of the Labour party, while not going so far as to call for total nuclear disarmament, object both morally to building a nation-annihilating weapons system, and pouring huge funds into doing so.\n\nWhat should the government's policy be?"

It is reasoned that taking the means of production out of the hands of profit-seeking capitalists will provide better conditions for workers and more useful output to the nation, but it will force the government to spend valuable resources intervening more directly in the economy."

    twrbritainpolitics.23.d:0 "Military spending is a contraversial topic, especially in these tense times. Maintaining a constant high level of military spending and low level of mobilisation has taken its toll on British finances, drawing funds away from the civilian economy and causing greater misery for the nation's citizens. This has led to many, especially in the Labour Party, calling for a reduction of military spending to fund national services. However, others point to the Nazi threat just across the channel, and say that Britain cannot afford to make itself less prepared for war."

However, against all odds, Attlee and his government has pushed through reforms and brought the party back together, reinvigorating the energy in the left that many thought had been lost. In the latest Labour Party Conference, a now clearly older and more tired Clement Attlee was nonetheless energised in reporting the successes, as the party was once again united and in power. While rumours that Attlee would resign during the Conference have been shown to be untrue, it is thought that his resignation is nonetheless imminent, him having been in government for an almost unprecedentedly long time."

With Germany's dominance over continental Europe, it is likely their next target would be the one European power that escaped their grasp - the UK. All in the government agree that, as well as the current measures in place, more preparations must be made in case of a Nazi invasion. However, with the economy in tatters, it remains to be decided whether the more ambitious measures of construction of additional coastal fortifications should go ahead."

    twrbritainpolitics.29.d:0 "A policy of rationing, limiting the amount of food people can buy by law, has been in effect ever since the war of 1939. Though the United Kingdom has been at 'peace' for over a decade, the high threat level and severe economic issues has led to the system remaining in effect ever since. While there are increasing voices to phase out the rationing system that has caused such discomfort to Britain's population, others, seeing the threat of a resurgence of war with Nazi Germany as a very real possibility, are urging caution and push for the policy to remain."

It is clear that, behind the veneer of rebranding, Oswald Mosley is still a fascist with sympathies towards the mainland European regimes, and a man and movement this dangerous cannot be allowed to threaten the nation ever again. While the government has agreed on a campaign to denounce this, the question remains on whether the movement should be officially banned.

Not only would control of their oil reserves be in the British interest, but the wealth from the oil could fuel the country into becoming a wealthy regional power and, as one that is friendly towards Britain and its allies, able to counter German and Italian influence in the Middle East.\n\nAs a result, it is agreed that we should send a delegation to improve ties with the Kingdom, but how far should we go in pushing for greater friendship and cooperation?\n\nOne proposal has been to make a comprehensive deal with the Saudis - Britain will guarantee their independence and promise to intervene militarily should it be threatened, while in return, British companies would be given extensive ownership and rights over a large proportion of Saudi Arabia's oil resources.

    twrbritainforeign.8.d:0 "Persia, or Iran, has increasingly become a pivotal nation in the region. While traditionally falling between Russian and British spheres of influence, the collapse of the Soviet Union and our past weakness had left somewhat of a power vacuum. The previous ruler, Reza Shah, made little secret of his pro-German leanings, though we could do little about it without heavy-handed options. Though he is now gone, his drift towards Nazi Germany still lasts, and doubt still remains as to whether his son, the young Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, shares his convictions. Many are calling for decisive action on our part, with backing from the US, to make sure the links between Iran and Germany grow no stronger.\n\nIn addition, this situation raises another, more cynical, opportunity. Iran is one of the largest oil producers in the world, and while Anglo-American corporations have some fraction of control over the oil supply, this is limited and has been increasingly pushed back. If we wanted to take control of Iran in one fell swoop, we could demand that control of the Persian oilfields are handed over on a much more comprehensive level to western companies."

    twrbritainforeign.9.d:0 "Long seeking to dominate our nation and scornful of our independence, the British have sent demands that we immediately cut our growing ties with Germany, as it creates a 'threat to international security'. While accepting would certainly be a humiliation, refusal could risk worse consequences. What should we do?"

While accepting would certainly be a humiliation and rob us of even more of our oil wealth, refusal could risk worse consequences. What should we do?"

    twrbritainforeign.11.a:0 "Excellent"
    twrbritainforeign.12.t:0 "Iran Refuses"
    twrbritainforeign.12.d:0 "Despite our... 'encouragement', the Iranian government has steadfastly refused to yield on our demands, labelling them a threat to their sovereignty, and condemning 'Anglo-American Imperialism'. Outraged at our demands, it is likely that the regime will pursue an even more pro-German policy going forwards.\n\nOur choices are two - either we do nothing, take the loss, and allow Persia to fall further into the Nazi sphere, or we intervene more... directly, despite the risks that kind of action would bring."

    twrbritainforeign.15.t:0 "Victory over Iran"
    twrbritainforeign.15.d:0 "We have taken and secured all of Persia through our military intervention, and [PER.GetLeader] has been overthrown and forced into exile. Now comes the question of what to do with the country that we now control.\n\nThe first option is to simply install a loyal government that will be under our watch. History has shown that the Pahlavi dynasty cannot be trusted to rule Persia and not drift towards our enemies, and so, a restoration of the old Qajar dynasty is on the table. The current head of the House of Qajar, Fereydoun Mirza Qajar, could be installed as Persia's new Shah, under a tight leash from London and Washington.\n\nThe second option is similar, with Fereydoun Mirza being installed as ruler, but we could also occupy the Khuzestan region of Persia. Ostensibly to 'protect the Arab population' in Khuzestan, the region holds Iran's largest oil reserves, and a direct occupation of this region could provide us direct control over these resources, as well as another base in the region.\n\nFinally, we could put these problems away for later, and occupy Persia directly for now, though this would certainly be met with hostility and cause greater strain and instability on our nation."

    twrbritainforeign.17.t:0 "Italian Takeover of Egypt"
    twrbritainforeign.17.d:0 "A recent coup in Egypt was worrying enough. Now, it seems the worst has come to pass. Italian troops, under the behest of the new Egyptian government, have entered the nation, securing the cities of Cairo and Alexandria. While Egypt had long slipped from our direct grasp, this last and complete takeover by the Italians is a clear threat.\n\nAll are agreed that the UK must denounce this action of aggression, though with the German threat being much more important, some are calling for that to be it.\n\nOthers insist that this encroachment on British interests and expansion of Italian control in the Middle East cannot be left unchecked. They are calling for Britain to demand Italian withdrawal, and in the mean time, block the Suez Canal to Italian shipping of all kinds in order to pressure them to accept. Which shall we do?"
    twrbritainforeign.17.a:0 "Denounce the invasion"
    twrbritainforeign.17.b:0 "Use proper measures"
    twrbritainforeign.18.t:0 "Britain Closes Suez Canal"
    twrbritainforeign.18.d:0 "It seems we underestimated the British determination in resisting our recent moves in Egypt. The British have closed the Suez canal to all our shipping, putting serious risks on our trade and connections to our colonies in East Africa. They demand that we withdraw from Egypt and accept the country's neutrality. Three options are in place for how to respond.\n\nFirst, we could simply comply with their demands. This would solve the crisis, but lose us everything we have gained.\n\nSecond, we could simply do nothing, weather the sanctions, and hope we can get around them in future.\n\nFinally, we could demand the British reopen the canal and lift the sanctions, though this decision has a high risk of conflict."
    twrbritainforeign.18.a:0 "Accept their demands"

    twrbritainforeign.19.d:0 "Far from accepting our demands, the Italians have threatened us with aggression, unless we reopen the Suez canal. Should we yield to their threats, risking humiliation but preventing war, or arrange a deal with the Italians?"

    twrbritainforeign.19.b:0 "Let's stall them..."
    twrbritainforeign.20.t:0 "Diplomatic Negotiations Started"
    twrbritainforeign.20.d:0 "The British government seeks to de-escalate the situation and has sent out an envoy to Rome. They are here to find a resolution to the Suez Problem, one which could prevent further tensions between the two major powers."
    twrbritainforeign.20.a:0 "Let the talks begin."
    twrbritainforeign.21.t:0 "The Talks Continue"
    twrbritainforeign.21.d:0 "Our diplomats have arrived in Rome and the talks have already begun. As the talks continued, the cabinet is now drafting a plan behind closed doors.

    twrbritainforeign.24.t:0 "British Deal"
    twrbritainforeign.24.d:0 "Finally reaching a deal, the British government has offered us a deal. They have yielded slightly and allowed our influence in Egypt to be maintained, but the regions around the Suez must be demilitarized for the security of British interests."
    twrbritainforeign.24.b:0 "We accept these terms!"
    twrbritainforeign.24.a:0 "We will manage without the canal!"
    twrbritainforeign.25.t:0 "Italian Terms"
    twrbritainforeign.25.d:0 "There is no doubt, we are losing the war. Not only have we failed to retake Egypt, but in a catastrophe we have lost control of both the Suez canal and Sudan. Now, the Italian government has sent demands for an end of the war, Demanding we not only recognise the Italian-backed government in Egypt, but also transfer the Suez Canal and Sudan to that new state.\n\nWith the military situation hopeless, most encourage us to accept the terms, however, some hawks encourage us to continue the war, in case by some miracle it can be turned around. What shall we do?"
