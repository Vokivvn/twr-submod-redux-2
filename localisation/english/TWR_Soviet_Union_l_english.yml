 SOV_kruglov_vision:0 "Director Kruglov's Report"
 SOV_kruglov_vision_desc:0 "In these unprecedented times, we are forced to call for unprecedented measures. The Union we know and love, the Union it has been my honor to serve, has suffered greatly from the malevolence of those who would have established a Degenerated Surveillance State in its ruins. They wrap themselves around every aspect of our daily life, and when it is time to call upon them they deny all accountability, even to the State and the Party - they believe they are the instrument of Lenin himself, above suspicion, above the Revolution, above the people. \n\nWe can no longer afford inaction, nor can we pretend that these hostile influences will disappear without inaction. I am asking you for a new Kronstadt. I am asking you to join me - so that we might save this Union from drowning on dry land."
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_flames:0 "The NKVD In Flames"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_flames_desc:0 "We have received reports that hostile activities are taking place against the so-called Internal Security elements of the Union, spearheaded by workers' organizations and the Red Army. This is not an unexpected response, nor is it something to fear. The sword of the wrathful Soviet worker cleanses at the touch, separating the good from the bad. And surely the NKVD of all Bureaus must understand the redemptive effects of revolutionary violence? \n\nWe ask only that those hostile elements within the Service submit themselves to the judgement that is rightly due them - all revolutionaries make mistakes, and in your service will lie forgiveness. If that is forfeited, however...you will come to realise the depth of your errors."
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_legacy_of_kalinin:0 "Legacy Of Kalininism"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_legacy_of_kalinin_desc:0 "Kalinin was a mentor to all of us, the father of the new Union, and the guiding hand keeping us away from some of our inherent excesses. Our deviations from the centralized production model led us into the hands of jackals and predators - I will not allow a recurrence in my capacity as Chairman. As we cast the horrors of the recent past away, let us instead look to the model that kept us alive even as the Deviationists tore down our works and the Germans feasted on our kind. \n\nKalininism works, my friends. With its light we were led to safety, without it we shall be extinguished. Let us hold the torch with a careful hand, and one day we might yet look upon the liberation of our nation and the world with clear eyes."
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_democratic_centralism:0 "Kalininist Democratic Centralism"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_democratic_centralism_desc:0 "Friends, let us speak of the worker. Perhaps here, in the Politburo, we have spoken at lacquered tables so long that we have forgotten how the people we serve actually live. This must explain why the petty politics of our little country-club seem so large on our minds - and why the country has languished under our failures, as if the Tsar had never died and the Vodka Tax was enforced still from Petrograd. \n\nLet us speak of the worker, and of how loyal we truly are to the dream of a state built to empower our people. For when we are honest in our failings, we can begin necessary corrections - and is that not the essence of an honest Marxist?"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_rehabilitate_stalin:0 "Officially Re-Habilitate Stalin"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_rehabilitate_stalin_desc:0 "Many ask why I have declared a Period of Introspection on the wartime Premier, Josef Vissarionovich Jugashvili. I ask you this: how can a nation without a clear understanding of its past ever gaze clearly at its future? Yes, Premier Stalin accumulated excesses in his regime. Yes, many of his actions were individually lamentable. They were also, however, critical in ensuring our industrial base stood strong enough to resist the Germans - if we crumbled after 2 years with Stalin, how long could we have lasted without his Five-Year Plans? \n\nComrade Stalin was not always a wise leader, but he was a visionary, a man who built the steel-and-iron dream our nation still reaches for. Let us forgive his excesses and honor what we can of his memory - and let us hope that when the Revolution sweeps the world, our descendants will judge us with the same mercy that we have judged our fathers."
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_deberiazation:0 "De-Beriazation"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_deberiazation_desc:0 "I wish to discuss with you one of the most pressing problems I have seen in the Union of today - I term this problem Beriaization, after the policies of one of my unlamented predecessors. It is a soft word for all the horror it invokes - for Beriaization is nothing less than the institutional perversion of Socialist Idealism to the ends of personal gain for a select few. The neo-bourgeois gained his wealth leeching off the farmer, the NKVD Commissar gained power leeching off the citizenry, and like a monstrous squid hunched over some infernal machine, Beria stood at the centre of it all. \n\nThese monstrosities were inhumane, un-Socialist and oppressive to the working class, and we shall waste no time in undoing them. From the fields to the torture chambers, let it be known: the State is coming to liberate the citizens of Russia, and it will sweep its enemies away."
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_power_to_politburo:0 "Transfer Excessive Power To The Politburo"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_power_to_politburo_desc:0 "We condemned Premier Stalin for his manifest failings - his personality cult, his inability to adapt, and his jealous hoarding of power from the Politburo - and yet I find myself shackled by the very same chains we all bemoaned. Let us be clear. I am no Stalin, nor am I interested in ruling by decree as the Politburo and the Party sit in terrified awe, as Stalin did. The last use of my unlimited executive authority, therefore, will be to limit it: the Bill sitting before you aims to create in the Politburo standing institutions to enforce the rule of law over me and my successors. \n\nThe Chairman's role will also itself be limited: as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Union, I will bind my decrees to a vote made within the Party leadership itself. I will admit that debating the minutiae of agrarian reforms does not inspire in me the greatest of zeal, but we must all make sacrifices for the Union's health."
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_party_democracy:0 "Restore Party Democracy"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_party_democracy_desc:0 "I have found, in my studies on the evolution of the Party, that one critical and worrying trend has emerged in all Revolutionary activities we have undertaken: the trend of power to move from the many to the few. Despite our talk of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, many have voiced their private concerns to me that we are becoming a Dictatorship of the Few, and that we will evolve into a pure Dictatorship as surely as day follows night. \n\nI must counter this tendency, which is surely a deviation from our aim of bringing liberation to the masses, wherever it is found. The opening of our inaugural Party Elections this year will allow for the contestation of multiple candidates for a representative position - and those found guilty of suborning the will of the people by sabotaging their candidates will be dealt with as harshly as is necessary."
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_central_committee_elections:0 "Have The Politburo Elect Ministers"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_central_committee_elections_desc:0 "As we continue to decentralize the Apparatus of State, it is my duty as Chairman to point out a focal duty for the Politburo to consider: our Ministers will serve alongside and in charge of all of you, and yet it is the Premiership that holds the reins of appointment. What an outrageous idea, and how utterly antithetical to the ideals of Soviet Democracy it is! Ministerial appointments will henceforth be proposed, evaluated and decided entirely within the Politburo itself. \n\nIf the enemies of the people, by some unlikely stroke of fate, infiltrate the highest offices of the State, I will retain extraordinary powers to retract these positions from individuals. Rest assured, friends, that it is unlikely this privilege will be exercised - and if it is exercised, we will have far greater problems to deal with than mere ministers."
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_anti_factionalism:0 "Anti-Factionalist Meritocracy"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_anti_factionalism_desc:0 "Our ultimate aim shall be the purging, in substance and spirit, of the reactionary elements that plagued the Union. While the appointment of bureaucrats and senior statesmen was based on securing the power of individuals, the collective suffered grievously for it. Such was the atmosphere that led to the Lysenkoist disaster under Premier Stalin, which caused a rapid collapse in grain outputs. It shall not be allowed to happen again. \n\nTo prevent another Lysenko, we must first cleanse this Politburo: I now appeal to all of you to give up your petty allegiances that interfere with the functioning of this State - and for those who will not comply, the harshest punishments we can bestow upon traitors will be awarded you."

It is an inevitability, and one worth celebrating at that - when the workers have grown strong enough in their ideological consciousness to seize power, we will know the State has succeeded in their education. With this success comes the opportunity to remove the potential for imposed deviations, particularly those who would use the power of the Commissar to install the fear imposed by a tyrant. \n\nEven in its shrunken state, there is hope for the NKVD: we shall repurpose it entirely, moving it into a role that truly befits internal security. The Commissars will never be allowed near real political power again, and in this domestic position they will focus their efforts on real enemies, not imagined or convenient ones."

Yes, the Vanguard Party stands not just as protective bulwark, but as active champion of the democratic will, and our relaxed restrictions on local elections will ensure that this will is not subverted through single-candidate elections. \n\nWith this act, we fulfill the mandate set before us by the crowds of the Petrograd Soviet so long ago, and we lay to rest the men and women who died in the Patriotic War: as they died to make the Union safe, so too shall we live to make its people free."

And look how they have benefited, comrades! They make hundreds of times the salary of the farmers they oppress, and we sponsor their horrific luxuries in the name of stability.

Through the grievous error of privatisation we encouraged not prosperity, but inequality of growth, for the value of their work was siphoned off to the middlemen who sold them. We must remedy this error through any means necessary, and the Agricultural Adjustment Act will act as a starter-course. \n\nPrivate land will be purchased by the State at fixed prices and their material value redistributed to individual farmers. These plots will be the breeding ground for a glorious new system, the Sovkhoz system, where all land is owned by the state. It will be a new dawn for Farmers, and for the Union as a whole."

It is incoherent, distasteful - and so is our toleration, our generosity even, to the protobourgeois classes that have emerged from these experiments in capitalism.

A vile abuse of the trust our fathers placed in them, and utterly unworthy of this Bureau - we will remove this privilege at once, and raid the offices of this Bureau for good measure. \n\nI would caution you all, comrades - we are not entirely safe from their reaches, and if anyone here believes himself to be under threat of bodily harm, it would be best to stay away from the Politburo for a few weeks.

Rapid allocations of NKVD members to vital security installations like the Gulag system and remote meteorological facilities shall serve as the first step to their re-education, a process that will no doubt take decades to complete. \n\nRegular classes will reskill these unfortunate workers in trades that truly benefit the Union.

With the Formal Political Exclusion Act, we shall at last bring these dreams back into the spotlight, for with this Act we shall bar the NKVD from political positions and end its association with the Party. \n\nNow, comrades, is the time to celebrate. The monster has been forever broken on the yoke of the State, and for the first time in decades, our citizens shall rest easy."

And so much yet remains to be done, for the old lands taken from us cry out to be liberated. Comrades, as we build the Soviet Dream, let us never forget that the Union looks not just inward for its completion, but outward. \n\nAnd as we look upon the Motherland, that which could yet be ours again, let the hope arise - our Russia shall yet be strong, free and whole, for if History is on our side, nothing could stand against us."

To the west, the Germans and their puppets rape and desicrate our homes. To the east, warlords and upstarts challenge our sovereign legitimacy. It is time for change once again, it is time to rejuvenate our great nation and end the half century of humiliation!\n\n" The room bursts into applause. On a raised balcony, Alexander Novikov watches carefully. Noting those few who refrain from clapping.\n\nAs the speech continues, Bulganin explains that Marxist-Leninism has clearly failed, and a new direction for the Russian people is needed. As a result, he declares the end of the Soviet Union, and the foundation of a new Russian Republic."

 twrsoviet.20.t:0 "The Lens Reversed"
 twrsoviet.20.d:0 "Some are calling it a bold literary reimagining of history, others the scrabblings of a madman; either way, Fyodor Ivanov's new novel The Lens Reversed is a work that cannot be ignored. The novel, published under Party auspices in the Soviet Union and disseminated, with much difficulty, by Marxist organizations across the world, describes a world where much the Roman Empire never fell - it embarked on the liberation of the South and North over the course of five centuries, before splitting into four cardinal directions.\n\nBut Europe, in this world, is but a backwater to the book's real focus in Asia: a rapidly modernizing Japan has colonized much of North America and Southern Africa, and in the Mongolian-Russian plains the strange, egalitarian creed of the Mongolian State has carved out a new vision for humanity. Ivanov's Mongolian protagonist, Bilguun, takes part in several pivotal struggles between the State and its imperialist American and Japanese rivals, including a long, bloody war along the Manchurian border that is a transparent parallel to the Great Patriotic War Ivanov himself experienced.\n\nAs Bilguun struggles against the decadence of his countrymen, he begins to take an active role in his country's own politics, while at the same time shaping the men and women around him into a noble, self-sacrificing force for the greater good. The novel ends on both a narrative and a global cliffhanger, with Bilguun announcing his abdication in favor of Yan Gamarnik, a follower of the strange new creed of Romanism, this timeline's equivalent of Socialism, and rebuild his world anew in the image of the militant-worker - as the Japanese and the Mongolians race towards nuclear weaponry, it is clear that the coming storm will be far more brutal than the last.\n\nInternational reaction has been mixed - one reviewer bitterly argues that "if statesmen were meant to dream about implausible worlds, perhaps Churchill would have kept his job" - but on the whole the novel has received a positive response. Several Asian Communist leaders have already noted the prominent role of Central Asian proto-socialist movements in the work as an implicit endorsement of their own struggles for national liberation, and the work has even made its way into the office of Ho Chin Minh himself, albeit in a much-abridged form."

 twrsoviet.21.d:0 "The Premier watches as the Mother - for that is what the sculptor calls her - is unveiled from the canvas that hides her. It's a relatively lightweight frame for a monument, and around the woman the still-scaffolded ruins of Moscow cast a grim backdrop to its hulking, brooding shape. \n\nNow the sculptor - Yevgeny Vuchetich, is that right - saunters to the Premier, his hand extended in subtle warmth. "Welcome to Moscow, Premier." He sweeps his hand at the statue of the Mother, its eyes darkened in shadow. "Welcome to my little handiwork - if you'll pardon the unfinished state." The Premier chuckles.\n\n"Thank you, Comrade Vuchetich. Even now, I can see the strength in her eyes." The statue exudes the latter, even with the strain visible from the child in the Mother's arms. The gaunt look about the Mother's face is framed in subtle, clenched jaws, and her fists are half-clenched. "Yes, strength and pain - fitting. It is a beautiful statue."\n\nVuchetich's own eyes grow distant. "Did you know, Premier? I planned this statue with my wife on my heart. She did not escape Leningrad, the poor fool." He's whispering now, a confession - or a plea. "I thought of how she would look with the child we raised, if she had known we would take it all back. This will bear her image, even if the face is not hers - please forgive this little transgression, Premier."\n\nThe Premier's words shock the little grey-haired man. "If she were here, Comrade Vuchetich, I know she would be proud. The blood of our martyrs is shed in hope." A hand is proffered. "And standing here, on sacred ground - I believe that hope has been fulfilled.""
 twrsoviet.21.a:0 "The two were silent for a long while, as the statue watched on."
 twrsoviet.22.t:0 "The Military Schism"
 twrsoviet.22.d:0 "As we work to make the necessary reforms to the country and system, the time has finally come to reform the armed forces. The army of our country has been tainted by Soviet fanaticism. It has committed numerous unjust acts in the name of the Bolshevik ideology, something we now know to be flawed. If our country is to be properly reformed away from this twisted form of socialism, we must work to remove any forces that may counter our reforms from the armed forces. With any luck, none of them will get any ideas of resisting these necessary changes..."
 twrsoviet.22.a:0 "The military stays loyal!"
 twrsoviet.22.b:0 "Hybridists take over!"
 twrsoviet.23.t:0 "Depoliticization Completed"
 twrsoviet.23.d:0 "Despite worries of backlash from the armed forces, the delicate balance has been maintained and the 'depoliticization' of the armed forces has been satisfarily completed. Political commissars have been abolished, and some of the more ideologically committed Marxist-Leninists honorably removed from their posts, which has led to a minor officer shortage, but overall the reforms have been steady out of necessity. For now, Bulganin's regime survives."

 SOV_kuznetsov_gulag_divisions_shock_companies_desc:0 "By taking violent convicts sent to the Gulags and mixing them in with disciplined NKVD and Red Army Officers we can create an effective Land Special Forces Platoon, made of Fast Moving and Heavily Armed, yet expendable Personnel. A lower cost Special Forces program of this size allows us to create a more effective Army more Loyal to their NKVD Handlers than their Red Army Officers, which continues to weaken and delegitimize the Red Army."
 SOV_kuznetsov_gulag_labor_industrial_complexes:0 "GULAG Industrial Facilities"
 SOV_kuznetsov_gulag_labor_industrial_complexes_desc:0 "While the main goal of Gulags is the punishment of its inhabitants we can't just ignore the needs of the prisoners for tools to make products and vehicles. For starters we can fund factories and other advanced industrial complexes that can facilitate production on a much larger scale. Advanced tools, such as drills and wrenches you see in civilian factories will become a common sight in the now industrial centers that are modern Soviet Gulags."
 SOV_kuznetsov_gulag_labor_minimialist_residence_complexes:0 "GULAG Residence Complexes"
 SOV_kuznetsov_gulag_labor_minimialist_residence_complexes_desc:0 "In order to establish Gulags as a permanent institution we must build apartments made of bricks that will replace flimsy log cabins that cause illness from the cold that decrease prisoner efficiency. It is not a matter of humanity but rather a way to increase factorial efficiency. Large brick factories permanently stuck in the ground give the appearance that they are here to stay, which they are."
 SOV_kuznetsov_gulag_labor_permanent_residence:0 "Permanent Residence Of Inmates"
 SOV_kuznetsov_gulag_labor_permanent_residence_desc:0 "Eventually, every inmate will leave eventually, and this presents a threat to our economy and if the intake and retention of our inmates goes down so will our economy. We must provide rewards to judges and juries with full conviction rates and who exaggerate crimes for longer sentences. With this, we create the permanent and systematic criminal-industrial complex that perpetuates a strong, Soviet Economy."
 SOV_kuznetsov_gulag_labor_quotas:0 "Prisoner Annual Quotas"
 SOV_kuznetsov_gulag_labor_quotas_desc:0 "Now that prisoners know they are in for the long haul in the gulags they will do anything for even a shred of freedom. We can use positive and negative reinforcement to promote the image of a productive but happy inmate. Inmates who fall below quotas will be severely punished and hope to god they don't do it a second time, meanwhile, prisoners who show great Proletarian Behavior will be able to visit families and friends."
 SOV_kuznetsov_gulag_labor_all_criminals:0 "Begin Phasing All Prisoners Into GULAGs"
 SOV_kuznetsov_gulag_labor_all_criminals_desc:0 "Now that we have finalized our efficient Gulag system to maximize production, we can abolish regular prisons which use inefficient and mostly optional labor programs. The Gulag shall become the staple of Soviet Law Enforcement and become main military production facilities, and so we have finally secured the Soviet economy for decades to come."
 SOV_kuznetsov_the_days_grow_dark:0 "The Days Grow Shadowed"
 SOV_kuznetsov_the_days_grow_dark_desc:0 "At 11:00 of [REDACTED], Sidorov Tomas Andreevich, a famous Craftsman who lived in the capital, was executed for the charges of Counter Revolution under Penal Code Article 58-1. Just seconds before Sidorov was executed he spoke his last words. \"For the days grow shadowed, Kuznetsov, the leader of the people has instead betrayed the int-\" The guards realized what happened and his execution was promptly sped up. The incident was leaked by a unknown guard and soon the capital was buzzing with rumors including a false story of Sidorov knowing of a corruption scandal and that the counter-revolutionary charge was fabricated."
 SOV_kuznetsov_gulag_economy:0 "The GULAG Economy"
 SOV_kuznetsov_gulag_economy_desc:0 "We have established the simple fact that for the Soviet Union to reclaim its old territory it must be able to have an effective and streamlined economy capable of putting out military products rapidly. In order to do that we must accept the additional fact that we need to prioritize Gulags over any other Economic Asset."
 SOV_kuznetsov_naval_central_committee:0 "Politburo Naval Advisory Committee"
 SOV_kuznetsov_naval_central_committee_desc:0 "The Navy maintains a lot of ties to the Red Army which had almost always maintained priority over the Navy. In our effort to punish the Red Army we must expand the government and party's influence over the Navy. For starters we can assemble a committee made of loyalists and naval experts so we have the power to halt anything that goes against our Anti-Red Army Agenda. The Committee is only a start and the Navy still thinks it is a mostly advisory organization. We must take other measures in the future."
 SOV_kuznetsov_naval_security_branch:0 "NKVD Naval Security Branch"
 SOV_kuznetsov_naval_security_branch_desc:0 "In order to root out both foreign and domestic enemies, most notably Red Army loyalists, we need a branch of the NKVD specializing in gathering intelligence in the ranks of dry and maritime sections of the Navy. By building a informant network we can prevent the recruitment of Red Army Supporters and Veterans and root out those who already take up positions of power."
 SOV_kuznetsov_the_lord_admiral:0 "The Lord Admiral Ascends"
 SOV_kuznetsov_the_lord_admiral_desc:0 "In order to maintain control over the Navy we need a permanent and good claim to an executive and powerful position within the Navy, For this we have created the Position of Lord Admiral of The Soviet Navy. By giving the position to Kuznetso we intertwine Soviet Executive Power and Naval Leadership into one. The High Command of the Soviet Navy merely at the Lord Admirals Whim."
 SOV_kuznetsov_naval_draft:0 "Instituting The Naval Draft"
 SOV_kuznetsov_naval_draft_desc:0 "With our Gulag Economy and highly efficient industry we now have the capability to field large fleets of ships that requires tens of thousands of Seamen and Sailors, which we do not have. To that we must begin conscripting able bodied males in the specific Naval Branch and devote more volunteers to the Navy rather than the Red Army which will help improve our naval strength while also damage the Manpower of the Red Army."
 SOV_kuznetsov_vampire_in_the_night:0 "Vampires In The Night"
 SOV_kuznetsov_vampire_in_the_night_desc:0 "The Red Army has a large amount of funding which contributes directly to the funding of traitorous Generals and cowardly Officers who failed us during the Great Patriotic War. With a little bit of corruption and sneaking around we can move funding from the Red Army and other Departments to the Navy, which has proven to be loyal and thus should be funded. Any General who notices this will unfortunately disappear the day of the budget change for unknown reasons."
 SOV_kuznetsov_naval_budget_committee:0 "Naval National Budget Committee"
 SOV_kuznetsov_naval_budget_committee_desc:0 "We need to assemble a group of Loyalists who will form the National Budget Committee of the Navy, we can assure the government can oppose any budget cuts that will harm the government's agenda. A budget committee can be one of the most powerful tools we have and once we take back control of the Army we can create one for that branch as well."
 SOV_kuznetsov_gulag_subs:0 "GULAG Submarine Tours"
 SOV_kuznetsov_gulag_subs_desc:0 "The job of a submariner is a fate that many Volunteer and Conscript Sailors suffer. By replacing the Submariners with Kulaks and other inmates we can avoid a hit of morale to our professional Navy and gain more favor with the common sailor by saving them from the depths of the ocean."
 SOV_kuznetsov_token_investments:0 "Token Heavy Industry Projects"
 SOV_kuznetsov_token_investments_desc:0 "We need to convince the people that the economy outsides of the Gulags is growing, to do that we need to continue regular construction of factories in urban areas and give hope to the workers of the Union. Along with providing hope they will also contribute a small amount to our total industry, but not on the same scale as our Gulags."
 SOV_kuznetsov_coastal_relocation:0 "Population Coastalization Program"
 SOV_kuznetsov_coastal_relocation_desc:0 "Most of the lands we inhabit are unfortunately barren and rural, by pouring money into infrastructure to small towns on the northern coast we can rapidly speed up the growth of these towns and create a more coastal culture to go along with our big navy. The North Sea is a very strategic location and the only access we have to maritime industry so we must utilize all we can."
 SOV_kuznetsov_vorkuta_incident:0 "The Vorkuta Incident"
 SOV_kuznetsov_vorkuta_incident_desc:0 "The Vorkuta Gulag has over 65,000 Inmates and represents one of the largest Gulags in our possession. After the Gulag Chief Zoya Voskresenskaya decided to cut rations and put more budget to guards salary, 53,000 of the inmates rose up while the other 12,000 were separated from the riot. NKVD responded but local forces were too small while the Red Army was reluctant to help, we suspect the Red Army was purposely sabotaging our containment. 327 Prisoners are confirmed dead while 23 Guards died 14 NKVD Agents died. We need to work on preventing this from ever happening again and use measures to prevent apathetic press from leaking this."
 SOV_kuznetsov_uprising:0 "The Perm Uprising....."
 SOV_kuznetsov_uprising_desc:0 "Even after we put press restrictions the news passed by gossip and now the capital of Perm is in flames. An estimated 23,000 people are rioting, 56,000 are protesting, and 89,000 workers are on strike. If we act swiftly and violently we can give an example of what happens when counter revolutionaries corrupt the mind of the proletariat and prevent smaller cities and towns from falling to disorder."

Lest we will be thrown in disarray once more, we will have to move quickly and crush any dissent and unify the supreme soviet once more."
SOV_stalinistdemocracy:0 "Stalinist Democracy"

#########Ivanov Union##############
SOV_ivanov_union:0 "Ivanov's New Society"
SOV_ivanov_union_desc:0 "The great union of soviets has been reborn, guided by the proletarian light of Zhukovist democracy and socialism. There is much to be rebuilt, but there is much zeal amongst our people. The Communist Party, under the leadership of comrade Inanov, will help us pave the road to true liberation."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd:0 "Repurposing NKVD Manpower"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_desc:0 "Our Union has long had the NKVD at its throat, a knife placed upon the throat of the people. Any utility the agency once had has long since dissipated, and now it is a bloated mess of terror, corruption and anti-Soviet intrigue. Thankfully, Comade-Chairman Ivanov has a plan: We will take this agency and radically reshape it to our own needs, turning the intelligence of the intelligentsia to a new end entirely.\n\nThe precise contours of our needs, however, are very much in debate. Some argue that the NKVD should be moved into the realm of theory - others argue for a more practical approach. Whatever we decide, it is clear that the Agency is about to change forever."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine:0 "From Oppressors Into Philosophers"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_desc:0 "The Internal Affairs Commissariat was initially set up to solve the problems of the Soviet Union, to regulate the transition into a workers' state. Now that the workers' state is here, they are functionally irrelevant. However, this does not mean that the NKVD is entirely useless. Their vast intelligence and the skill with which they surveyed and monitored dissent can be turned to the intensive sphere of economic theory, which also requires the management of vast stores of information. More importantly, their penetration of all aspects of civilian life ensures that they will have access to civilian consumption patterns - the data practically pays for itself."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_charity:0 "From Thieves To Volunteers"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_charity_desc:0 "Starting the process of reform for the most feared agency in the Union was never going to be easy. With expectations of entrenched opposition, the Premier has decided to take a more - ah - hands on approach to the process. We will drag the NKVD into the light by sending them into the cities and towns to perform public service. Trials by some of our Youth Corps Battalions have proven promising in the countryside, and the Premier has every hope of success.\n\nIf it does not succeed, of course, we will also threaten them with public action to hound them into submission, which should teach them a lesson or two about defying the will of the people."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_guards:0 "Orders Into Actions"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_guards_desc:0 "The root-and-branch reform of the Commissariat must start with its order system. The old NKVD was a mishmash of internal security departments with mandates to perform everything from policing to fire services, interlinked only by exchange of information and a common badge - this was what made the agency so ubiquitous and uncontrollable, even by Stalin himself.\n\nThis must change. The centralization of the Department into a single governing body accountable to the Politburo will limit abuses, and from this platform we can continue further reform."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_informants:0 "Secrets Into Theories"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_informants_desc:0 "The extensive files of the Security Apparatus are its most infamous aspect - it is known that every Soviet Citizen has either a file in the NKVD's halls or an imminent warrant for their arrest. We can, however, put this invasive data to good use by turning it all into economic data - consumption patterns, social group patterns and internal psychology can be traced from a person's life.\n\nAs we take the guns away from their hands, we will also give the Agency new life by instructing them to retabulate this data into a body of evidence our Economic Planning agencies can use, and build recommendations on its backbone. We will, of course, ensure this data is turned anonymous, starting with the senior members of the Politburo. Entirely for state security purposes, of course."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_officers:0 "Weapons Into Pamphlets"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_officers_desc:0 "The development of every security apparatus requires a propaganda effort, to disguise its tracks and to assure the public of their good will. This was true for the fascists and it will be true for us - the NKVD's next big step will be to redouble its external propaganda to reduce the negative reputation we have long had in the eyes of the people. Massive reductions in our internal use of violence will follow it, as we begin to outphase the Commissariat's violent tendencies altogether.\n\nSome might compare our efforts to attempting to put nice clothes on an already dead man, or to firemen arriving six hours after the house has already burnt to the ground. They might be right, but they are also utterly unhelpful. We will be sure to target them when the first batch of propaganda comes in."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_bureaucrats:0 "Meetings Into Debates"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_bureaucrats_desc:0 "The NKVD does not usually meet in private. It would be too easy to identify senior members who could in turn be targeted for blackmail by our own internal moles within the Service. Instead communications were done in private, between anonymous members of departments whose sole job was to pass orders given by unnamed superiors. This gave the NKVD its infamous reputation for impenetrability, and made it feared even in the eyes of the Red Army.\n\nThis will have to change. A forced Congress will reveal to the Politburo and Soviet people who the leaders are, painting a giant red bullseye on the leadership's backs should they fail in their desire to serve the Union - and it will encourage constructive discussions on the ongoing Theoreticization process, which is no doubt a useful secondary goal."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_leaders:0 "Power Into Praxis"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_leaders_desc:0 "The transition rolls on in the halls of the NKVD. As the Commissariat retools itself into a wholly theoretical organization, slowly but surely it has become beneficial to the Soviet people. Already suggestions from the Commisariat's new Advisory Boards (for some reason the civilian-oriented Boards are the most enthusiastic in this regard) have been received, on a wide range of economic and sociopolitical topics.\n\nWith little indication that the agency is returning to its old ways, we have also decided to increase their autonomy to go out and perform Marxist praxis within the population itself. They will take on advisory roles everywhere in the Government and the state agencies, building bridges and mending gaps. It will be a real rebirth for them - let us hope the Union is ready for it."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_operatives:0 "Silencers Into Megaphones"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_operatives_desc:0 "The last step of dismantling an internal security organization is the destruction of its suppressive mechanisms. Every NKVD cell had a unique set of blackmail documents meant to suppress societal dissent within the organization or social sector they were located in - we will force these cells to destroy these materials, or face the retribution of a very, very angry Red Army.\n\nThese materials will be replaced with survey forms and census registration documents, to amplify the voices of the people where it matters. While the Internal Security Commissariat might never have thought of becoming a glorified survey team when it was first established, it is vastly preferable to the alternative. We will take every opportunity to remind them of this."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_philosophy_ministry:0 "The Ministry Of New Philosophy"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_philosophy_ministry_desc:0 "The formal establishment of the Ministry as a firmly theoretical instrument will allow us to do one last shakeup of the apparatus, rooting out any opposition to our plans that might have previously surfaced. As they are sent to the prison camps, their brethren will formally adopt the trappings of bureaucratic personnel without the violence that supported their activities. In time, the NKVD will be rehabilitated entirely - at least, that is the plan.\n\nWith a change in name comes a change in methodology. The Renunciation of Violence Act will forever destroy all hostile weaponry and equipment once in possession of the Ministry, and the records of all who were killed will be sent to State archives, where hopefully they will never appear again."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_charity_guards:0 "Batons Into Hammers"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_charity_guards_desc:0 "The Corrective Labor Order will be the first step to physically removing the Commissariat from its position of almighty power over our people. We will sentence all of the NKVD former leadership to the hard labor they deserve, to toil in labor facilities and in corrective farms. The bureaucrats, on the other hand, will get a gentler hand - they will only perform corrective labor for a matter of weeks, at factories and generally well-run state agencies.\n\nThe treatment will continue until they are willing to wholly renounce their previous actions, which will not take long at all.

It is time to further that by enforcing compulsory public service quotas through this surveillance system, punishing those who do not adhere to the orders we have issued.

These obligations will involve intangible deliverables as well as the tangible - they will be required to report on potential subversive activity on the part of their former colleagues, on pain of additional punishment by the state.\n\nAt some future date, we might consider withdrawing these obligations when they have served their purpose.

There is a cost to this, however, as our conventional motorized units are equipped for infantry-support roles. It will take time and money to retool our most advanced motorized formations into a true large-scale force capable of large-scale offensives - even so, it will be worth the effort when the Finns are pushed to their old borders."

A limited blockade would reduce the capabilities of the border army and perhaps pressure the Government to the negotiating table, but more subtle approaches like a gradual integration into our economic sphere and the lowering of tariffs could incentivise them to make a deal of their own free will.

Installation of massive towers across the Nation will herald the rise of this new system, and with it a new age for Russian electricity."

Ambitious plans to revive the industry of the Far East can now be realised, with the help of local investments in industry and infrastructure: our experience leading such dual-track projects elsewhere in the Union will make this smoother, no doubt. The hostile presence of Chinese forces in the southeast will only make this a higher strategic priority - without functioning infrastructure, reinforcement for our garrisons will be near-impossible."

We must purge this stain from the Union at all costs, even if it means Vladivostok must be purged in a sea of blood to finish the job. And when we are done, and the last imperialist-opportunist is driven into the Pacific, we will raise the banner of Socialist Victory - and the world will tremble at its shadow."

SOV_zhukov_baltic_ssrs_desc:0 "Ostland is a state built on oppression as deep as the day is long, and we fully intend to uproot this system entirely. This will probably be a violent and chaotic process in itself, but the price of anti-imperialist activity has always been worth paying. In any case, we are certain that the expulsion of German citizens will yield rich benefits for the native collaborators we will be displacing - although their armies might have to be crushed to do so."

SOV_zhukov_vasilys_sojourn_desc:0 "Vasily Stalin, ever the pain in our behind; well, we can deal with irritants with relative ease, especially ones with roots in our present border wars. The Caucasus was the ancestral homeland of his family, and far-off Georgia is the perfect place to send this idiot son of Stalin to reflect on the practice of Socialism; hopefully this war will become such a protracted mess that Vasily dies a quiet death in his reminisces. Well, that or we shoot him."

SOV_zhukov_rokossovskys_price_desc:0 "Rokossovsky has served us well enough in his present duties, even if the Marshal does get a little strident in his political opposition to our work. Very well - we shall give him a hero's reward! Rokossovsky shall lead the march to the Vistula, retaking Poland from the clutches of the vile collaborationists who have seized it from the Germans, and when he is done we shall install him there as our leader. This will, of course, be a lifelong work, and to make sure he gets the message he will be barred from ever re-entering the Union."
SOV_zhukov_karelia:0 "Ultimatum to Finland"

Never mind! We shall right this wrong by simply threatening the Finnish to hand over what is ours - and we will let the Army do all the talking for us, should they refuse."
SOV_zhukov_besserabia:0 "Send Malinovsky Home"
SOV_zhukov_besserabia_desc:0 "Ah, Marshal Malinovsky; loyal, outspoken, intense and annoyingly independent. We value his immense contributions to the Liberation Struggle, so much so that we believe a retirement is best to allow him to rest from his exertions. This retirement will be enforced directly from High Command, and it will deliver him to the noble place of his birth; we will install a ceremonial position upon him and bar him from ever speaking out against the Leader again. Soviet politics, as they say, is simple: we hold the guns and you hold your words. A shame he had to learn this the hard way..."
SOV_zhukov_gotenland:0 "The Monster By The Sea"
SOV_zhukov_gotenland_desc:0 "The German occupation of the Crimea and southern Ukraine is the supreme example of Nazi brutality and colonialism in our fatherland.

In order to truly reclaim our fatherland, we must remove this monstrosity from the map."

SOV_zhukov_call_up_everyone_desc:0 "Our armies are coming ever closer to the wretched borders of Germany.

SOV_zhukov_reunify_command_desc:0"The invasion of Germany cannot be left to decentralized military structures, for those can breed opportunism and ineffectiveness.

SOV_zhukov_green_light:0 "Their Land, Their People, Their Blood"
SOV_zhukov_green_light_desc:0 "Our time has come! We have all that we need to begin our final campaign of liberation against Germany.

SOV_zhukov_volkshalle_desc:0 "Now that we have well and truly excised the Nazi German threat, we must begin the work of removing the spectre of Nazism forever. Much will have to be done in order to achieve this goal, but we can begin by removing the physical symbols of Nazism in Germany. The Volkshalle, that wretched building where the Nazi empire legislated itself, will be turned into an embassy for us.

We will also sponsor generous price-controls on farming equipment that should aid these brave farmers in making a life of their own.\n\nReports that this action will create more harm than good, and that small town Russians are totally inadequate to the harsh climatic conditions of actual farming, should be ignored entirely as counterrevolutionary behavior.

This should hopefully spur the kolkhoz system into productivity as well, ensuring that demand-side pressures remain in place despite our lack of a free market.\n\nThis has the useful secondary effect of providing an outlet for our political opponents to be demoted: throw them into the administrative apparatus of a failing kolkhoz, deny them material, and within the year they will be begging to be thrown into prison.

The time has come for an inherently Socialist approach to science to displace the bourgeois reified stupidity that is 'Darwinism'. That approach is Lysenkoism, which treats Soviet plants as the unflagging workers they truly are - and propels them ever upward through material stimulus, like exposure to cold or heat, to fertility and abundance.\n\nSome biologists have called this approach 'mad', even outright 'murderous', to our farmers.

It could yet prove our salvation now.\n\nBy adopting the city as our official standard bearer and implementing Magnitogorsk Model Projects across the Union, we shall enforce the same quotas, harsh work hours and intensive production practices that made the Steel City so effective.

We will begin retooling industrial workers in our cities for work in the countryside, build vast new facilities in concrete for them to work in the vast Ural plains, and attach them at strategic junctions in our road network to ease transportation costs.

Bukharin's championing of the New Economic Policy might have been popular in a time of immense crisis, and it certainly influenced its successor Kalininism, but his uprooting of Marxist doctrine endangered the nation's move to Socialism. Worse, the NEPmen who resell agricultural produce in the markets have become Bukharin's partners in crime, making a mockery of socialist equality! In the place of solidarity we have built a pigpen and called it Communism!\n\nNow that a new brand of Socialism is in vogue, it is time to destroy Bukharin's spectre, officially deplatforming his ideas of limited private industry.

This must change. If people do not truly believe in Socialism, all our central planning and welfare reforms are pointless, like painting the walls of an already burning house.\n\nWe have two broad directions, one orthodox, one, well, Orthodox, to choose between.

There have always been heroes - and now these Heroes will receive the recognition they so richly deserve.\n\nThe trick, of course, is to weave these cults of personality around a rich thread of Marxist theory. We have a firm foundation for this in the stories of Marxist individualism circulating in the pre-Revolution era, which also emphasize personal heroism and working for the people.

Only bourgeois dissidents would claim that a lecture on the building of sound electrical systems cannot be leavened with a demonstration of the power of historical materialism. Indeed, who is to say that the material world does not operate by the same forces that drive Marxist analysis - power, struggle and class solidarity?\n\nThese ideas could give us room to expand the institutions of technical learning, and as ever, it will only come at the cost of a little curricular alteration."

Already massive imports of concrete and steel are being shipped from overseas to begin the official foundation-laying - they say that when it is built, it will be the tallest tower in Russia!

Our next move will surprise many - but it will surprise the forgotten Church most of all.\n\nChairman Zaytsev has decreed that the Church will be re-engineered to buffer the spirituality of the Soviet Soul. The recitation of Psalms, the giving of Communion and the highest sacred art of iconography are to receive lavish state attention. Senior statesmen will make going to Church fashionable again.

If we are ever to succeed in developing a truly Socialist Orthodoxy, we must turn this engine back on - and for this, too, Zaytsev has a plan.\n\nWe will officially incorporate the Orthodox Church into the workings of Soviet industry and agriculture, allowing their rituals to be conducted in conjunction with the affairs of state. Re-education of workers will take on explicitly religious overtones, priests will develop quotas on weekdays and souls on weekends, and churches themselves will now preach the Gospel of the Many rather than the Promise to a Few.\n\nReports of initial anger and rejection across the Church's autocephalous divisions are merely that, reports. When the system stabilizes, we are sure to succeed. Anyone who says otherwise had best watch their lips, lest the wrath of God be incurred."

Just as Christ is two natures in one man, the true Church is both Christ-natured and Lenin-natured: two lungs through which the Church breathes secular and spiritual air.\n\nAccusations that this is nonsense, heresy and even outright insulting to the image of Christ shall be met with prompt defenses in the form of State-sanctioned heresy trials. We shall tolerate no insults to the work of the Exalted Restorer, nor shall we accept a breach of the Orthodox Church whose work he has secured for eternity!"

SOV_zaytsev_knights_transition_desc:0 "The Knights of Lenin are a critical instrument of the state, no matter how much mockery they are shown by the apparatchiks. In the new Socialist order the Chairman envisions, they will keep the proletariat vigilant by guarding them against ideological threats - and the vanguard responsible, by acting as a buffer between them and the People. The Knights are our future, and now the contours of that future must be decided.\n\nThe main decision we must make is a simple one: will the Knights be a military organization or a civilian-dominated one? The power of the gun is not to be underestimated in influencing state-policy, but our ideological needs could arguably be served better by the adoption of Civilian Knights. In either case, much will need to be changed from the top down, as the Knights prepare to meld the ancient with the modern once again. No less than Russia itself is at stake."

The Knights shall forever be military, their service determined on how well they serve the State as a paramilitary wing - and their ability to make their weapons useful to the People by destroying their enemies.\n\nThis also requires a substantial amount of retraining and logistics work, as our Red Army is unsurprisingly reluctant to cooperate with the Knights when it comes to giving up their precious arms to their peers. We will need to inflict heavy political pressure to ensure it happens, and conduct a little pre-emptive purging to smoothen the transition. Hopefully the rest of the Government will prove more cooperative..."

There is an inherent congruence to their function. We shall formalize this congruence by merging the functions of the two groups: from now on, the Vanguard of the Vanguard shall serve the State in wartime and the People in peacetime, cross-training and mutually assisting each other.\n\nFrom a certain point of view, this could look like a coup of the Army's power base. It could even be said to be a transition into rule by paramilitary force. Those points of view are WRONG! The Knights' service shall be so exemplary that it will shut these dissenters up, if the State does not get its hands on them first!"
SOV_zaytsev_service_membership:0 "Membership Through Armed Service"
SOV_zaytsev_service_membership_desc:0 "To formalise the hierarchy of the Knights along military lines, it will be necessary to make the Knights themselves work in military roles. How can an organization enforce discipline in the People if it does not first learn discipline itself? The Knights will therefore be formally inserted into the Red Army, with a period of national service as a prerequisite for joining. Thanks to our earlier merger of the Knights with the Shock Infantry, we are confident that they will serve with merit in any number of infantry roles!\n\nJust in case the Red Army does not get the message and, ah, read the room, we will also ensure the Knights will be disproportionately hired for political-officers to keep the soldiers in line. It would be very, very unwise for these loyal, radical elements to get wind of possible dissent or conspiracy in the ranks. Very unwise indeed."

Their roles are simple: they will conduct regular ideological sessions and inspire the masses to excel in their work for the Revolution, while also conducting administrative work in tandem with the authorities.\n\nWith the Knights' dedication to serving the People undimmed, they will identify potential troublemakers within our administration itself, honing the State like a sharp knife.

This must be rectified.\n\nTo even out the numbers, we will assist the Knights in asserting presence in urban and rural population centres. Our existing cadres will be encouraged to actively seek out the Knights and make every effort to cooperate with them - rejection will be taken as proof of disloyalty and treated as such.

They will spend their lives removed from distraction, from the seduction of bourgeois decadence, and they will live as examples of the Socialist ideal - they will ascend from mere men to icons of the Immortal Science.

The secret police will also bring expertise to some of the surveillance operations the Knights have been conducting in areas of suspected cryptofascist activity, and an endless appetite for, ah, revolutionary violence.\n\nWe understand that this will be a controversial move, even an unpopular one, within the Knights.

Even total pseudo-science, such as psychokinetics, are experimented on and gain funding and resources from an obsessed Konev.\n\nThe experiments are only just beginning, and their usefulness to Soviet society or the Soviet army is extremely questionable, but they will nonetheless be a key feature of Konev's dark agenda going forwards, performed in secret locations dotted around Central Asia and Siberia..."

sovietinsane.5.d:0 "Travel in the rump Soviet Union has always been, not only made difficult due to geography, but deliberately restricted by authorities. Now, with Konev's strengthening of internal travel restrictions and setting up of more checkpoints, travel within the territories of the Soviet Union has been even further restricted. Internal passports and other documentation are required at all times, and most people are not permitted to travel beyond their hometown without a very good reason.\n\nBy restricting the people's movements, their every action becomes more coordinated and organised within the Soviet state."

With the Soviet Union so destroyed and destabilized already, we cannot afford to let any kind of dissent or subversion fester in the factories and alleyways of the cities we still control.

Though their former leader, Beria, is gone, they still deserve a strong place in the new Soviet society, and Konev's own rule will be benefitted significantly by their cooperation as well.

Broadcast and shown to the few in the Soviet territories who have access to a television or radio, the weary-eyed defendants are brought before the judges, their crimes read out before them. Yet there is little beyond that of a 'trial' to speak of. All the necessary 'evidence' has already been collected, poured over, and the verdict is the same and a non-question. In many cases, the defendants themselves confess to their crimes and their alleged treason to the Soviet Union.

A faction known as the NKVD-R, Right NKVD or Bulganites, supported Bulganin's leadership over Konev's. It is this faction that, after much preparation, has become the latest target of Bulganin's brutal purges. In a long-planned and well-coordinated action, Bulganin supporters within the NKVD were rapidly arrested with brutal efficiency across the Soviet territories.

Thousands are executed, mostly by firing squad or a shot to the head, and in a few spectacular cases, by being shot by heavy weaponry like tank and anti-air guns.

Thousands of documents, any that could be captured before burnt, are paraded in front of a Soviet jury, with all of Germany's crimes against the Soviet Union listed for the people to see. For once, there is no need for crimes to be made up or even exaggerated, the \"defendant\" has committed crimes against the Soviet people that are very real and can be attested by all. The scale of the crimes is still impossible to fully verify due to the thorough and near total destruction of eastern Europe, but it is clear they go unmatched in all of history.\n\nAs the trials come to an end after a very quick period of deliberation by the judges, the harshest sentence was given to Germany as a whole in absentia, many in the Soviet Union for once agree that in this circumstance, Konev's cruelty may be warranted."

sovietinsane.13.d:0 "Of all of Unit 17's experiments, this was perhaps the most insane. Numerous experiments were conducted in order to develop a way for psychokinetic abilities - the ability to move objects at a distance using only the mind, also known as telekenesis - to be manifested. As expected by anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of basic science, these experiments yielded no results in their aim, and all attempts to create telekenesis have failed.\n\nOn the other hand, with experimental subjects being severely traumatised and disturbed by the concoction of drugs and horrific processes they were exposed to during the experiments, the tests have yielded an accidental success. New techniques in 'enhanced interrogation' have been developed, passed on to the NKVD as a whole."

Meeting Prime Minister [ENG.GetLeader] in London alongside the Queen, the two national leaders took in the sights of the old and spectacular city in a much-publicised visit.

twrsovzhukov.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union's most decorated and successful military commander, Marshal Georgy Zhukov, has secured his leadership of the remnants of the Soviet Union and been made Premier in Perm. One of the few Soviet commanders to repeatedly succeed in battles against the German invaders in the Nazi-Soviet war, to many it was clear that, despite not being the favourite of the powerful NKVD, Zhukov would rise to ultimate power over what was left of the Union. From now on, it will be this man's vision that will drive the Soviet Union forwards, and he is dead-set on reunifying the nation, smashing the Nazi menace and liberating territories that have been torn away."

On a visit to Germania, formerly known as Berlin, a collapse of part the badly damaged Volskhalle crushed and killed several people during an inspection of the building, including Marshal Zhukov himself. There are rumours circling of foul play, but for now, it is being considered an extremely tragic and unfortunate accident.\n\nWith such a sudden and unexpected power vacuum, the Politburo has been thrown into     and wrangling, as leading figures in Zhukov's government wrestle for power. It remains to be seen who will come out on top."

 SOV_Revise_the_New_Economic_Plan_desc:0 "Stalin's economic policy, which focused primarily on the collectivization of agriculture and the rapid development of the industrial sector, while letting the agricultural sector work in its fields without any subsidies or time, was the primary factor that destroyed the Soviet Union. We have to look back and remember what Comrade Lenin told us during the Civil War, arguing that agriculture must have a share in the state economy and that we must open markets to reach the words of Karl Marx, but now we have in mind that too much reliance and dependence on their work can damage our income and lead to the backwardness of our economy. If we succeed in bringing together a mix of civilian and military industries, agricultural facilities with the nationalization of public sectors such as banks, we can ensure that our economy experiences the boom we had between 1922 and 1925."

Looking at the documentation and reports sent to us, we can agree with the leading economic experts that the measures we had to take showed, in what situation we find ourselves, the results which are quite good and encouraging. If we push through a couple of mistakes we made in the initial parts of our plan, refining those mistakes, we will be able to approach the Politburo with our report that will further encourage further development of our plan."

With small changes in the report, neglecting some bad words that might affect the decision when it comes to approving the REP, but we do not doubt that the results that were shown in the short term could lead to reflection during the meeting. But again, we have to be careful, just in case that reconsideration occurs."

 SOV_The_Second_Phase_of_NEP_desc:0 "Pushing the plan through a meeting with the Politburo, we can turn the next chapter in this novel called REP. By securing short-term gains in agriculture and smaller urban areas, we can confidently approach the construction and upgrading of existing factories as well as opening opportunities for the poor people most affected by Stalin's disastrous policies. Civilian and military production must be on the next hit of our reforms and if we manage to apply REP to this type of production with at least the same amount of success as agriculture, we will have a healthy economic profit."

 SOV_The_Civilian_Sector_desc:0 "One of the two main problems we have to devote time to is the light and heavy industry of the civil sector in the production of basic things, from food to textile products whose production will have to be stronger than agricultural sector, concerning the progress made by farms because the period from 1922 to 1925, it showed that if farmers could overpower the industrial sector, we can never reach our goal. Therefore, we will redirect our investments, as well as allowing foreign investors a share, towards the light industry."

Insufficient attention and maintenance of the military sector caused the collapse of our army, but this time it will not happen, either now or in the future, because if we lower just one look or have only a small moment of inattention, everything will collapse.

SOV_re_rehabilitate_malenkov_desc:0 "While the 19th Congress rehabilitated Georgy Malenkov, the decision was political and obviously a mistake. If there was one thing that Lavrentiy Beria got right, it was the decision to condemn Malenkov and his moderate, spineless ways.\n\nTo properly correct and readjust the Communist Party's ideological function, Georgy Malenkov's rehabilitation decision must be overturned and his guilty status must be reinstated."

SOV_rapidly_expand_army:0 "Rapid Army Expansion"
SOV_rapidly_expand_army_desc:0 "Recently, the obvious economic difficulties of our exile to the Urals and Western Siberia have led to difficulties in maintaining a large standing army. The lack of manpower has meant many military-age men have been working on farms, factories, mines etc. in order to produce the necessary resources to continue our country's perilous existence.\n\nThe time for laziness, however, is over. As we see signs of instability within the Nazi Reich, we must prepare once again for war, and move to expand our army into fighting shape no matter the cost."

SOV_collectivize_economy_desc:0 "Since the late 1920s, the Soviet economy, both in terms of its industry as well as its agriculture, has been a collectivised one. Stalin courageously enforced collectivisation with an iron fist, crushing any dissent against it during the 1930s. Since then, however, the instability caused by the defeat in the Great Patriotic War has caused our discipline to lax. Many collective farms and industry have reverted back to informal private control. This must be put to an end, to ensure the continued functioning of the Soviet state."

SOV_building_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "Marshal Chuikov is a strong personality, and the effectiveness of a cult of personality can be best examined in the Nazi cult around Hitler.

SOV_hero_of_stalingrad:0 "Hero of Stalingrad"
SOV_hero_of_stalingrad_desc:0 "The people must be reminded and never forget that it was Marshal Chuikov who led the heroic defence of the city of Stalingrad. Though the city eventually fell to the crushing German advance, an effective hand-to-hand defence mounted by Chuikov's men within the city held the Germans back for many months, and inflicted significant casualties on their men, ultimately giving the Soviet army time to reposition and evacuate from the Caucasus in good order. \n\nOfficial media and propaganda will be reminded to emphasise this great wartime exploit, and Chuikov's crucial role in bringing it about."
SOV_discredit_old_generals:0 "Discredit the Old Generals"
SOV_discredit_old_generals_desc:0 "While Chuikov was mounting a brave defence of Stalingrad, the rest of the Red Army was floundering and failing. Generals such as Zhukov, Rokossovsky and Konev are near household names in the remaining free areas of the Soviet Union, despite their failures and clear military inferiority compared to Chuikov's exploits. This must be fixed immediately - media and propaganda will emphasise the incompetence of much of the Soviet top brass in contrast to Chuikov's iron determination and military genius, until the people consider him the greatest hero of the Great Patriotic War."
SOV_defender_of_gorky:0 "Defender of Gorky"
SOV_defender_of_gorky_desc:0 "After the Fall of Stalingrad and general retreat, the Germans entered Gorky and threatened Kuybyshev. While the government fled to Perm, an counter-offensive was organized to alleviate the pressure and prevent a total collapse of the Southern Front.\n\nGeneral Vasily Chuikov contributed to this successful operation, eventually forming a hedge in the German lines and helped greatly in the recapturing of Gorky. While it was unfortunate that the Red Army failed to maintain the momentum, the state can surely spin this success story into a positive media campaign for Marshal Chuikov."

Today, we unfortunately find ourselves again in a similar, if not even more dire, situation.

And as Kalinin's protege, Turkenich has learnt and he only has two words to say: no more.\n\nIvan Turkenich refuses to be a pawn, the Komsomol and the Young Guard are foolish in thinking that they have found themselves another Kalinin.

 twrUSSR.1.t:0 "A Fractured Union"
 twrUSSR.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union was greatly damaged by the significant losses in the Patriotic War. This sad state of affairs only worsened upon Premier Joseph Stalin's disappearance during the chaotic relocation.\n\nDuring the interim period in the temporary capital - Perm, Mikhail Kalinin assumed the reign of party leader of the USSR. However, Mikhail Kalinin's declining health proved to be a vital tool for power grabbing, allowing Lavrentiy Beria greater influence in the functions of the state. As the Interior Minister, Beria used his powerful position to launch purges against his future enemies. Upon Kalinin’s death in 1946, Georgy Malenkov was sworn in as the next chairman. However, Beria was quick to overturn the line of succession, accusing Malenkov's "gross incompetence" as part of the reason for the Union's shortcomings, then proceeded to enact a new wave of political purges against his political opponents and various other military officials. Amidst the chaos, a plot by traitors to the Union were revealed, causing many conspirators to escape eastward, forming their own sepratist entities that are currently beyond our sphere of control. While this move might have saved their lives, they have allowed Beria to remain as the nation's new paramount leader.\n\nWith Lavrentiy Beria and Mikhail Suslov forming an ad-hoc solidarity alliance, Beria's characteristics drastically shifted to a moderate stance after he assumed leadership. Granting many political prisoners amnesty while announcing capitalistic plans, attempting to rescue the dying economy. But, his popularity within the establishment remained low, with secret plots forming in his shadow."
 twrUSSR.1.a:0 "Soon, the motherland will be one!"

 twrUSSR.2.t:0 "Initial Results of the REP"
 twrUSSR.2.d:0 "Launched by General Secretary Lavrentiy Beria in 1948, the Revised Economic Plan is Beria's magnum opus. Revoking much of Stalin's collectivisation efforts, the REP attempted to rescue the dying economy with a series of capitalistic reforms. With efforts such as allowing private enterprises to operate, reintroducing a market system for most produced goods, and employing experts for state industries.\n\nWhile the economy is still pathetic, the REP has made noticeable progress in improving the Union's economy. Across the spectrum, it all looks positive, despite the fact that some major underlying issues are starting to surface."
 twrUSSR.2.a:0 "Great progress!"

 twrUSSR.3.t:0 "A Report to the Politburo"
 twrUSSR.3.d:0 "Members of the Politburo gathered in Perm, each issued a document titled "Report on the Progression of the Revised Economic Plan". Lavrentiy Beria stood and read its contents to the entire Politburo, but a few notable members were seemingly unamused by these reports. For example, besides a few nonchalant claps, Mikhail Suslov ignored Beria's briefing, meanwhile Ivan Turkenich raised concerns over the growing divide between urban and rural citizens. Nikolai Bulganin was the most enthusiastic about the report, but suggested that the country needs to commit even more drastic actions, which sparked a heated argument, resulting in multiple members repeatedly calling Bulganin "a filthy revisionist".\n\nNonetheless, the meeting ended in silence, with members returning to their normal duties in a sour mood."
 twrUSSR.3.a:0 "The atmosphere is tense..."

 twrUSSR.4.t:0 "The REPmen"
 twrUSSR.4.d:0 "Product of Beria's capitalization efforts, businessmen have expanded their operations and started running shops and other forms of corporations. Alongside this, a new middle class has appeared, dubbed by many as the "REPmen".\n\nThese "REPmen" have acquired better living conditions and the ability to purchase extra commodities compared to the typical Soviet citizens. This increase in wealth have also increased their social influence and status, and the Soviet government must pick a position regarding this issue."
 twrUSSR.4.a:0 "Round the dangerous ones up!"
 twrUSSR.4.b:0 "We must tax them!"
 twrUSSR.4.c:0 "This is clearly a sign of progress!"

 twrUSSR.5.t:0 "The Civilian Sector"
 twrUSSR.5.d:0 "As part of the Revised Economic Plan, capitalist practices have been introduced to the civilian sector. As a result, commodity production has increased and a somewhat stable light industry goods market has been established. However, when the second phase of the REP is being drafted. the government is splitted on how the Union should approach this question in a proper manner."
 twrUSSR.5.a:0 "Recollectivization!"
 twrUSSR.5.b:0 "Distribute the surpluses to the poor!"
 twrUSSR.5.c:0 "Privatization!"
 twrUSSR.5.e:0 "Hire more talents for state enterprises!"

 twrUSSR.6.t:0 "The Military Sector"
 twrUSSR.6.d:0 "The biggest industry of the Soviet Union, the military sector is the most important part of the Soviet Union. The regime's focus on military production is largely unchanged and remains as the sole issue that most members can agree upon, since this matter of national reclamation and security is simply nonnegotiable in the minds of our people. With the profits of our REP flowing in, we must reinvest them into the military."
 twrUSSR.6.a:0 "Let the guns flow!"

 twrUSSR.7.t:0 "Military-Business Ties"
 twrUSSR.7.d:0 "During the reopening of private enterprises, the military has engaged in business ties with certain corporations. Some military formations have been outsourcing the task of maintaining military supplies to private individuals, which might be both a blessing and a curse.\n\nThe central government is aware of this developing situation, and it is finally time to make a decision."
 twrUSSR.7.a:0 "Crack them down!"
 twrUSSR.7.b:0 "Tolerate this relationship."

 twrUSSR.8.t:0 "The Great Homefront"
 twrUSSR.8.d:0 "Since the collapse of the Soviet front, a new kind of war has been raging ever since. The so-called War at the Homefront, the government is desperately trying to outproduce Germany in the hopes of eventually returning to Moscow. And as the Revised Economic Plan seems to be working, the Politburo has announced a new "offensive" on the homefront, aiming to ramp up production across the board for the upcoming unification war."
 twrUSSR.8.a:0 "Workers, unite!"

 twrUSSR.9.t:0 "Preparations for the Congress"
 twrUSSR.9.d:0 "To prepare for the upcoming 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, security in Perm has been adjusted accordingly. However, the government was presented with a choice, the choice between increasing the NKVD presence in the city and using the Red Army as additional support for the city's security."
 twrUSSR.9.a:0 "Increase the presence of NKVD!"
 twrUSSR.9.b:0 "Use the Red Army for reinforcement!"

 twrUSSR.10.t:0 "The 19th Party Congress"
 twrUSSR.10.d:0 "The first party congress held after the embarrassing retreat from Moscow, the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union features all major politicians that have chose to remain on the side of Perm. Many new faces have appeared since the last congress, as the party members that have fled to Novosibirsk and Krasnoyarsk have refused to interact with Perm.\n\nFew foreign dignitaries have agreed to attend the congress, with the only notable ones being a handful of representatives attending on behalf of the Communist Party of China.\n\nWith the members gathered and ready for the upcoming days of congress, a brief opening ceremony was held and the congress has begun."
 twrUSSR.10.a:0 "Let us begin!"

 twrUSSR.11.t:0 "Report on the Progress of REP"
 twrUSSR.11.d:0 "General Secretary Lavrentiy Beria was the first to speak, informing the party of the progress on the Revised Economic Plan.\n\nLavrentiy Beria exclaimed that significant progress has been made, and within years, the Soviet Union will be capable of besting the Nazi invaders and drive them out of Russia. He also mentioned the improving economy to the party, praising the party officials for the hard work they have done throughout the years."
 twrUSSR.11.a:0 "Then they all clapped."

 twrUSSR.12.t:0 "Suslov's Speech"
 twrUSSR.12.d:0 "Head of the Secretariat and Orgburo, Mikhail Suslov was the second to perform a speech for the Communist Party and was invited to speak on the operation summary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\n\nMikhail Suslov started his speech in a timid manner, following the script closely and focused on the report. However, the speech became increasingly unpredictable, as Suslov made seemingly passive aggressive remarks towards the reformist elements of the party. At one point, Suslov commented on the Communist Party in Novosibirsk, sarcastically saying that "The revisionism present in this room is something that even the traitors at Novosibirsk would gasp at."."
 twrUSSR.12.a:0 "..."
 twrUSSR.12.b:0 "Many cheered for Suslov..."

 twrUSSR.13.t:0 "Our Anti-German Crusade"
 twrUSSR.13.d:0 "The youngest full member of the Politburo, Ivan Turkenich was the third major politician invited to perform a speech.\n\nThe main goal of his speech was to reaffirm the Communist Party's commitment on the elimination of the Nazi threat from the Soviet Union. In this fiery speech, Turkenich called for the "Anti-German Crusade", calling for every Soviet man and woman to remain restless until the workers' paradise is achieved."
 twrUSSR.13.a:0 "Unanimous support!"

 twrUSSR.131.t:0 "A Warning"
 twrUSSR.131.d:0 "[URGENT, TOP SECRET]\nTitle: Urgent Activity Report on Possible Conspirators\n\nIntelligence Officers have captured a conspirator within the Red Army stationed on the outskirts of Perm. Attached is a list of associates related to this conspirator, preemptive actions are recommended. Act immediately."
 twrUSSR.131.a:0 "Perform secret arrests at once!"
 twrUSSR.131.b:0 "The warning did not reach the agency."

 twrUSSR.132.t:0 "The Extraordinary Session"
 twrUSSR.132.d:0 "A special speech that was not initially planned, Lavrentiy Beria performed a brief, 15 minute speech to the attendees.\n\nThe subject was national security and party unity, Beria condemned some recent incidents as "enemies of the state plotting for the Union's demise", hinting towards the latest arrests performed and the crushing of a possible coup.\n\nSeveral members of the Politburo were visibly uneased by Beria's speech."
 twrUSSR.132.a:0 "The message is clear."

 twrUSSR.133.t:0 "The Party Boss"
 twrUSSR.133.d:0 "In the last days of the party congress, the motion to pick a new Central Committee has finally arrived. Alongside this, is a secret confidence vote, determining if Lavrentiy Beria is truly fit for duty as the nation's paramount leader.\n\nWhile Lavrentiy Beria can choose to entertain with this idea, the general secretary can simply "remind" the members to vote in a correct manner."
 twrUSSR.133.a:0 "Let the party decide."
 twrUSSR.133.b:0 "For the sake of unity..."

 twrUSSR.14.t:0 "Perm's Longest Day"
 twrUSSR.14.d:0 "Two hours ago, the NKVD operation headquarters in Perm lost contact to the rest of the security apparatus. When special task forces were dispatched to reestablish contact with the rest of the NKVD, the members arrested by Red Army soldiers. Following these arrests, multiple trucks belonging to a motor rifle division tasked with guarding the perimeter of Perm arrived at the multiple NKVD offices in the city, carrying with them truck loads of soldiers and officers tasked to monitor NKVD movement and arrest Lavrentiy Beria on the behalf of the Politburo.\n\nWithout much resistance, Lavrentiy Beria was arrested and Sergei Kruglov was promoted to the position of "Chief of NKVD", followed by a radio announcement by the Politburo regarding the formation of the Emergency Committee and the temporary suspension of the Party Congress."
 twrUSSR.14.a:0 "Like clockwork, it all happened..."

 twrUSSR.141.t:0 "The Secret Trial"
 twrUSSR.141.d:0 "Brought before a political court in a secret location, members of the Politburo such as Mikhail Suslov, Nikolai Bulganin, and Ivan Turkenich served as both judge and witnesses to a secret, hardly proper trial. It only took approximately 5 minutes before a verdict was made, and Lavrentiy Beria was unceremoniously executed and cremated on the spot.\n\nIn the Emergency Committee's public press release, it is stated that Lavrentiy Beria was charged and convicted of treason and rape, stating that the decision was made in a fair, transparent, and just manner."
 twrUSSR.141.a:0 "The fat man is no more."

 twrUSSR.1411.t:0 "Lavrentiy Beria Executed!"
 twrUSSR.1411.d:0 "Shortly after Lavrentiy Beria's brutal fall from power, the Soviet government launched an extremely speedy trial that would condemn the "Chief of Terror" to his own death.\n\nDuring this trial, enemies of Beria served as all three components of a court, resulting in an unanimous conviction by the jury and the judge, founding Beria guilty of rape, treason, and murder. On the same location, Beria was quickly executed. Alongside the press release, a photograph of Beria before hauled to the site of execution was also published, and audio of the trial was also broadcasted on the radio, where listeners can hear Lavrentiy Beria pleaing Not Guilty to all charges against him."
 twrUSSR.1411.a:0 "A significant death."

 twrUSSR.142.t:0 "The Battle for Perm"
 twrUSSR.142.d:0 "Unruly elements of the NKVD have refused to follow Perm's directives and have launched a counter-offensive against the Emergency Committee. The streets of Perm have been transformed in a battlefield, a sight similar to the desperate fighting during the Siege of Moscow."
 twrUSSR.142.a:0 "The NKVD strikes back!"
 twrUSSR.142.b:0 "They were no match!"

 twrUSSR.143.t:0 "The Party Congress Resumes"
 twrUSSR.143.d:0 "Restoring order and ending the hegemony of the NKVD faction, the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has resumed. Members carried on as usual, seemingly forgetting the fact that just a few days ago chaos engulfed the city and paralyzed the government.\n\nOn the first day of the Congress' resumption, Nikolai Bulganin represented the Emergency Committee and raised a motion titled "Regarding the Rehabilitation of Georgy Malenkov and Victims of the Revisionist Overcorrection Attempt", calling for the rehabilitation of almost all of the political purge victims of Lavrentiy Beria during the Kalinin regime. The motion was passed with a majority, and Malenkov is posthumously awarded for his attempt at leading the country."
 twrUSSR.143.a:0 "Business as usual."

 twrUSSR.144.t:0 "A Struggle in the Committee"
 twrUSSR.144.d:0 "The Emergency Committee is collapsing.\n\nWith members varying drastically in terms of ideological beliefs, the Emergency Committee will not last until the party can pick a new, agreed upon leader of the nation."
 twrUSSR.144.a:0 "The party will decide!"

 twrUSSR.15.t:0 "A Coup in Perm"
 twrUSSR.15.d:0 "Despite Lavrentiy Beria's extreme unpopularity in the political class, previous attempts at removing him from power were not successful. However. the most recent overthrow attempt was finally successful.\n\nMembers of the Politburo and the Red Army cooperated with one another to launch this successful coup, managing to restrain the NKVD and installing a new joint leadership known as the Emergency Committee. Lavrentiy Beria's current whereabouts are unknown, but sources suggest a trial will be held in the near future."
 twrUSSR.15.a:0 "The climax of a power struggle."

 twrUSSR.16.t:0 "NKVD Countercoup"
 twrUSSR.16.d:0 "Unsatisfied by the actions of the Emergency Committee, the NKVD has launched a countercoup reinstating the NKVD government without the presence of Lavrentiy Beria.\n\nNKVD forces were able to restore the status quo government under a new leader, Sergei Kruglov, the successor to Lavrentiy Beria. Promising an end to instability and infighting, Sergei Kruglov has assumed the role of paramount leader of the Soviet Union."
 twrUSSR.16.a:0 "Another coup..."

 twrUSSR.17.t:0 "The Kalininist Victory"
 twrUSSR.17.d:0 "Ivan Turkenich, protege of Mikhail Kalinin and a former partisan leader turned influential member of the Politburo has been affirmed by the Communist Party as the new General Secretary, effectively becoming the new leader of the Soviet Union."
 twrUSSR.17.a:0 "New blood for the union!"

 twrUSSR.171.t:0 "Turkenich in the USSR"
 twrUSSR.171.d:0 "A leadership change has occurred in Perm. Ivan Turkenich, a relatively unknown political figure outside of the USSR has assumed the role of General Secretary.\n\nA protege of Mikhail Kalinin and a former partisan, Ivan Turkenich is considered by most as the candidate of the grassroots wing of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and it is expected that much of Beria's privatization efforts would be rolled back under Turkenich's regime."
 twrUSSR.171.a:0 "Another leader in the USSR."

 twrUSSR.18.t:0 "Beria Stays"
 twrUSSR.18.d:0 "Despite the opinion of some members of the Politburo, the party has placed their faith in Lavrentiy Beria's leadership abilities and has once again elected Lavrentiy Beria to continue serving as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union."
 twrUSSR.18.a:0 "The leadership stays."

 twrUSSR.181.t:0 "Beria Stays in the USSR"
 twrUSSR.181.d:0 "Time and time again, multiple conspiracies attempted to remove Lavrentiy Beria, but each time they failed, and the most recent attempts were no different.\n\nOut of fear or genuine approval, Lavrentiy Beria's role as General Secretary has been reaffirmed by the Communist Party, a significant sign of approval and marking the end of a troubling period."
 twrUSSR.181.a:0 "Business as usual."

 twrUSSR.19.t:0 "The Orthodoxist Victory"
 twrUSSR.19.d:0 "Mikhail Suslov, leader of the Orgburo and the Secretariat has successfully climbed his way to the top of the party apparatus, affirmed by the Communist Party as the new definitive General Secretary.\n\nClaiming the leadership of the hardliner faction after the departure of the initial plotters to Novosibirsk, Mikhail Suslov is a strong proponent of the traditional way of Soviet decision making, and Suslov has made secret remarks, hoping to revert almost all of Beria's revisionist policies."
 twrUSSR.19.a:0 "Return of the old line."

 twrUSSR.191.t:0 "Suslov in the USSR"
 twrUSSR.191.d:0 "A leadership change has occurred in Perm. Mikhail Suslov, a black horse of the Communist Party since the power vacuum left by the Novosibirsk-Perm Schism has successfully secured himself the role of General Secretary.\n\nA strong advocate of traditional Soviet ideological thinking, Mikhail Suslov used his significant influence in both the Orgburo and the Secretariat to gather a great deal of support for his movement."
 twrUSSR.191.a:0 "Another leader."

 twrUSSR.20.t:0 "The Reformist Victory"
 twrUSSR.20.d:0 "Nikolai Bulganin, leader of the reformist faction has won over the party's majority, and was successfully appointed as the party's new General Secretary.\n\nOut of pragmatism or genuine concern for the Union, Nikolai Bulganin found power in appealing to the reformist faction, agreeing with Lavrentiy Beria's Revised Economic Plan but criticizing it for "not going far enough". Now, with Bulganin's faction in power, it is expected that the capitalistic policies of the REP will be expanded and further developed."
 twrUSSR.20.a:0 "A new line for the union!"

 twrUSSR.201.t:0 "Bulganin in the USSR"
 twrUSSR.201.d:0 "A leadership change has occurred in Perm. Nikolai Bulganin, leader of the reformist, dubbed by many as the "revisionist" faction has been appointed by the Communist Party to serve as its new General Secretary.\n\nAdvocate of even more extensive capitalistic policies during the reign of Lavrentiy Beria, Nikolai Bulganin successfully mobilized and captured a majority within the Communist Party, a major ingredient of Bulganin's success."
 twrUSSR.201.a:0 "Another leader."

 twrUSSR.21.t:0 "Red Army Coup"
 twrUSSR.21.d:0 "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has failed to settle on a definitive leader that can serve the Soviet Union.\n\nWhen the politicians were busy bickering with one another, the restless Red Army leadership has finally decided to take matters into their own hands, and conveniently major members of the Communist Party have already gathered in the same city.\n\nWith one order, Vasily Chuikov ordered his officers to organize multiple strike forces and entered Perm with minimal casualties. During a session of the congress, military officers entered the chamber and arrested all of the notable members of the Communist Party, allowing the foreign dignitaries to leave unharmed. Afterwards, Chuikov announced the formation of a military government, the ultimate attempt at rescuing the Soviet Union from the brink of destruction."
 twrUSSR.21.a:0 "Wha-..."

 twrUSSR.22.t:0 "Perm Demands Annexation"
 twrUSSR.22.d:0 "Urgent message from Perm!\n\nThe Central Committee has declared the goal of our Military Okrug fulfilled and have ordered us to hand over control to the newly appointed party authorities intended for our region. What should our response be?"

 twrUSSR.22.b:0 "Not without a fight!"

 twrUSSR.23.t:0 "Kazan Okrug Integrated"
 twrUSSR.23.d:0 "Without resistance, Ivan Konev and his staff have recieved our orders, handing over effective control of the region to the new civilian administration, marking the end of the Kazan Military Okrug and its anti-terrorism mission."
 twrUSSR.23.a:0 "A more unified union."

 twrUSSR.24.t:0 "Perm Demands Annexation"

 twrUSSR.25.a:0 "A job well done."

 twrUSSR.26.t:0 "Vasilevsky Recalled From Retirement"
 twrUSSR.26.d:0 "After Lavrentiy Beria arrested then executed both Semyon Timoshenko and Kliment Voroshilov, field marshal Aleksandr Vasilevsky was thought to be the next on the butcher's chopping board. Due to his outspoken discontent towards Lavrentiy Beria, it was rumoured that Vasilevsky joined the Zhukovites and was planning to flee east. However, Vasilevsky was saved by the direct intervention of Field Marshal Vasily Chuikov and many members of the loyal Red Army in Perm.\n\nInstead of meeting the same fate as the other two prominent field marshals, Vasilevsky was forced into retirement, being demoted to an insignificant work team vice chairman of the Relocated Frunze Military Academy. Despite this humiliation, Vasilevsky did not venture east, he chose to stay with the Perm Soviet Government.\n\nNot long after Lavrentiy Beria's fall from grace, the Red Army formally reinstated Vasilevsky's rank as field marshal, hoping that such an important military talent would not go to waste."
 twrUSSR.26.a:0 "Welcome back!" 

 twrUSSR.27.t:0 "Perm Moves To End Okrugs"
 twrUSSR.27.d:0 "[SOV.GetLeader] has seen our use to have fulfilled its purpose. He is now moving to formally bring us back into the fold, fearing that our built-up power base might also pose a threat to them."
 twrUSSR.27.a:0 "Damn, we will have to act quickly then." 

 twrUSSR.211.t:0 "Military Coup in the USSR"
 twrUSSR.211.d:0 "With a gridlock in the Communist Party, the leadership of the Soviet Union was effectively paralyzed.\n\nExhausted by the pathetic state of affairs demonstrated by the politicians, the Red Army under Vasily Chuikov has launched a military coup against the Communist Party, forming a military government. In a radio address shortly after the overthrow of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Marshal Chuikov denounced the former Soviet leadership as "decadent", exclaiming that the Communist Party has lost its ways and values and only the wisdom of the Red Army can save the Soviet Union from destruction."
 twrUSSR.211.a:0 "The military is fed up."

 twrBERIA.1.t:0 "Change in the Orthodoxist Leadership"
 twrBERIA.1.d:0 "The disgraced Mikhail Suslov failed to depose Lavrentiy Beria, and was speculated to be a main organizer of a foiled coup attempt. As an act of self preservation, Mikhail Suslov has willingly resigned his post as Orgburo secretary and from the Politburo.\n\nOut of the "kindness" of his heart, General Secretary Lavrentiy Beria appointed Mikhail Suslov to steel production in Magnitogorsk. In his absence, Stalin's protege - Vyacheslav Molotov has assumed the leadership of the Orthodoxist faction, while maintaining a cooperative manner towards Beria's NKVD faction."
 twrBERIA.1.a:0 "A useful old man."

 twrBERIA.2.t:0 "Turkenich Disgraced"
 twrBERIA.2.d:0 "In an official bulletin released by the temporary party headquarters located in Perm, Ivan Turkenich has been found guilty of "Bonapartism" and was immediately expelled from the Communist Party. In a more proper announcement, party officials and investigators from the NKVD accused the former partisan of "attempting to build a cult of personality to subvert revolutionary action".\n\nAs yet another act of "benevolence", Lavrentiy Beria opted to forgive these crimes and allowed Ivan Turkenich to live quietly in the countryside while under NKVD surveillance. Without their charismatic young leader, the Kalininist faction has evaporated."
 twrBERIA.2.a:0 "A threat removed."

 twrBERIA.3.t:0 "Bulganin Handled"
 twrBERIA.3.d:0 "On the surface, Nikolai Bulganin and Lavrentiy Beria seems to be political allies and cooperated in the execution of the Revised Economic Plan. However, this was far from the reality of the situation. Secretly, the NKVD has gathered enough evidence to prove Bulganin's connections to the foiled coup just weeks ago.\n\nWhile Beria and Bulganin still exchanged pleasantries in public settings, the latest edition of the Politburo composition and the minister positions have been shuffled. As a reward for Nikolai Bulganin's cooperation with the reform plans, he has been assigned to the most sacred position of "Minister of Arctic Fisheries", sent to the northernmost naval hub to oversee village fishermen."
 twrBERIA.3.a:0 "Hope he enjoys the frozen waste."

 twrBERIA.4.t:0 "Beria's Party"
 twrBERIA.4.d:0 "With no grandiose announcement or any ceremony, little by little, the opponents of Lavrentiy Beria's faction were defeated. The entire party has learnt to fear Beria's masterful abilities in eliminating his opposition, choosing to remain quiet despite their own political alignment.\n\nThe General Secretary's position is now consolidated, and the party now lays firmly within his fingers."
 twrBERIA.4.a:0 "The general secretary is absolute."

 twrBERIA.5.t:0 "Beria Thaw"
 twrBERIA.5.d:0 "In a closed door meeting between party officials and members of the government, an important decision was made regarding the social atmosphere of the Soviet Union.\n\nAnnounced on Radio Moscow and printed on the front page of all major Soviet newspapers, General Secretary Lavrentiy Beria and his cabinet has announced a list of groundbreaking reform plans.\n\nThe Central Committee has promised to uphold freedom of speech and the freedom of assembly by lowering the restrictions set by the censor and licensing bureau. In addition, the government is now encouraging creative expression that would "improve the quality of life", while allowing a limited amount of criticism to be raised on local politicians and lower party officials. However, any published political commentary will still be vigorously reviewed to ensure political stability, and anti-Soviet rhetoric will remain banned."
 twrBERIA.5.a:0 "Interesting times ahead."

 twrBERIA.6.t:0 "Operation Housecleaning"
 twrBERIA.6.d:0 "For the longest time, a faction within the NKVD threatened Lavrentiy Beria's rule. This clique, headed by Viktor Abakumov, managed to maintain influence thanks to the protection of influential members of the Communist Party.\n\nHowever, with the conspirators finally handled, Viktor Abakumov and his cronies have nowhere to hide."
 twrBERIA.6.a:0 "They picked the wrong side."

 twrBERIA.7.t:0 "The Purge of Purgers"
 twrBERIA.7.d:0 "With Abakumov out of the picture, the staff and officers that have contributed to this operation shall be rewarded.\n\nRewarded with their names on a list and a crime associated to their name.\n\nIn yet another effort to clear his own name, Lavrentiy Beria and his most loyal supporters have orchestrated a purge of the NKVD, pinning almost all the crimes committed during his regime to these officers. Alongside the secret arrests of these individuals, Beria simultaneously made the matter known to the party, and since his loyal staff recorded the NKVD personnel's family information, the scapegoats were blackmailed into compliance."
 twrBERIA.7.a:0 "Nobody is above responsibilities."

 twrBERIA.8.t:0 "BGB Formed"
 twrBERIA.8.d:0 "The State and Security Bureau is Lavrentiy Beria's catch-all solution to the divided intelligence capacity of the Soviet Union. Being a merger of almost all agencies including the NKVD, the BGB is responsible for all aspects of political warfare and intelligence operations. Former operators of the different agencies have been reassigned to work in the BGB, and have sworn a new loyalty oath to General Secretary Lavrentiy Beria and the Communist Party."
 twrBERIA.8.a:0 "Beria's super agency!"

 twrBERIA.9.d:0 "The room was secluded and prepared specifically for this occassion. Beria waited outside, alongside the guards guarding both sides of the door. Looking at them, he asked, "Do I look like a clown?" And they had to shake their heads because they didn't dare to tell him that it looked like a folded bag of fleas. Shortly after, he heard loud footsteps approaching the corridor. Vasily Chuikov was approaching them with a serious expression, sharp and strict. He extended his hand when they met, offering a firm handshake. "Greetings, comrade." "Greetings," Beria replied. Beria then gestured, leading Chuikov into the room while the guards remained on duty. Sparing no time for filler, Beria reminded Chuikov the purpose of this meeting.\n"So, Comrade." Beria fiddled with his glasses. "I can assure you, the Union appreciates your military service. It would be a shame to have it challenged by a few...incidents."\n"What are you implying, comrade?" Chuikov snaps back. "The NKVD has discovered multiple links connecting you with the mistakes committed by those dogs led by Mikhail Andreyevich...General; we truly admire your work, and I - personally, have already dismissed these reports."\n"What do you want."\n"You see, the motherland is desperate for unity. And as the national heroes that we are, I can let let bygones be bygones if we can assure your cooperation." Beria takes off his glasses.\n"The Red Army is your domain, but your men must be on the party's side." Chukov shows slight hesitation before bursting into laughter, extending his arm and offered another handshake.\n"We have a deal, Pavlovich.""

 twrBERIA.12.t:0 "Suslov Executed"
 twrBERIA.12.d:0 "Following a gradual fall from grace over the recent past, and a temporary stint as party commissioner in Magnitogorsk, Mikhail Suslov was stripped of his party membership and internally exiled to the Frozen Arctic under close NKVD supervision. This situation continued for several days while a state of legal limbo held over the former secretary of the Orgburo, while backroom deals and power struggles occurred in Perm following his departure. Earlier today, following a presumed agreement within the politburo, Suslov was arrested and charged with posession of "Disturbing Paraphernalia and Media", described as pornography, snuff films, and much worse. After an 11 minute trial, he was convicted and hanged summarily in front of a party verification troika.\n\nThus ended one of the most illustrious, and turbulent, careers of a soviet politician in recent memory. Despite having a reputation tarnished by anti-semitism, Russian chauvinism, and opportunism, Suslov had long been one of the most powerful men in the USSR. Suslov had represented the Orthodox faction within the USSR, that had often vaccilated between opposing and supporting the dominant power of Premier Beria. This continued for nearly a decade under the Permier, until his recent set of political reforms. Suslov and his faction opposed these reforms, for which they were purged and gutted, now being led by a fragile and old Molotov.  The legacy of what some have already begun calling "The most mysterious man in the Politburo" will be forever remembered for his tainted by his misdeeds, but it will forever be *remembered*."

 twrBERIA.13.t:0 "The Partisan Purge"
 twrBERIA.13.d:0 "In the waning hours of night yesterday, a drastic series of arrests were carried out throughout the USSR. Sources are indicating that tens of thousands of former Partisans have been arrested in what Premier Beria has described as a "Purge of Defeatists and Opportunists". Party officials also confirmed the arrest of "Comrade" Ivan Turkenich, former leader of military operations amongst the Partisans.  These facts combined have come together to illustrate a total removal of former Partisans from the state apparatus and military within the USSR.  These arrests are a drastic reverse from Premier Beria's earlier policy of expressly integrating former Partisans into the state, leading to many rumors as for the cause of this recent purge.\n\nThe question is not a difficult one. Comrade Turkenich's Partisans had become the main support block of the "Kalininists", who had often opposed Beria within the Politburo since his replacement of Kalinin.  Following other recent purges of anti-Beria groups the Partisans appear to have been the next in line, to the surprise of nearly no one in the Union itself.  However Global interests such as the US and British governments, in a quite rare moment, have commented on this recent Soviet political development, condemning it for "Persecuting the very men who have fought to keep Beria's rump Union alive. In typical form, the Premier and the party rejected any International interference in Soviet affairs, quickly referring to the German-Soviet War, where the west was silent as a sign of a lock of moral authority."

 twrBERIA.14.d:0 "Early yesterday morning, NKVD officers and agents quickly drove up to and surrounded Nikolai Bulganin's Arctic dacha, and arrested the Minister Of Arctic Fisheries. Charged with accepting bribes from Finnish shipping corporations, the Minister was quickly arraigned in front of a show trial early this morning. After only 37 minutes, the presiding legal "Troika" unamiously voted to find the Minister guilty of the charges, and sentenced him to be shot. The minister was afforded the chance to give any last words, to which he said "I feel no need to dignify the wishes of a Fat Man in the Kremlin." He was then shot by a firing squad, and his body cremated and thrown to the wind.\n\nThe minister had a turbulent career under Stalin, avoiding purges and rising through the ranks of the party. His loyalty to Stalin vanished upon the latter's death, after which the minister became a supporter of Bukharinist reforms, and embracing a limited market to renovate the nearly destroyed USSR. Under Secretary Kalinin he gained influence under the "Revisionist" wing of the party, and a lukewarm alliance with Secretary Beria continued this. Only with the recent suspected coup attempt did the minister fall from grace, and rapidly find himself in a powerless position. His execution only confirmed those suspicions, and he has retroactively been condemned, and his supporters have begun to be purged and removed from government positions."

Each national leader brought entirely different problems to the workplace, from the lack of direction during the war days, the laziness of the Kalinin Era, and then the corruption and rising inequality between workers and supervisors in the Beria Era. The protagonist feels powerless, and found himself unable to cope with an increasingly hostile society, but did managed to gain solace in knowing that life might be better for the coming generations. While the language in this book is not inflammatory, some have observed that the author seems to be criticizing the Beria government, warning that their actions have betrayed socialist ideals, paving the way for a return of the bourgeoisie."

This meeting was arranged due to the fact that Masherov caught the attention of the central committee for his personality and outstanding work in administrating areas liberated by the  Belarusian resistance. After a pleasant conversation between the two, Turkenich invited Masherov to serve in the central government and promised to fast track his career, which Masherov accepted.\n\nMasherov older than Turkenich by two years, and his more down-to-earth, modest demeanor might be the perfect counterbalance for Ivan Turkenich's rather hotheaded, scheming allies in the Young Guard and the Komsomol."

However, after a long period of uncertainties, the Soviet government has declared an official restart to the Communist International.\n\nIn its absence, the Communist International lost much of its international influence, and this was apparent in the organization's restart ceremony.

Therefore, in order for a new, different style of administration to hold power, it is important to reassure these mostly aging old men.\n\nWhile they might disagree with reforms and our potentially radical ideas, Nikolai Bulganin and his ministers came up with an ingenious idea - appealing to their total dedication of stability and national security. Using the "greater good", convincing the most influential old members of the party would ensure the compliance of the influential old guards.\n\nThey might dislike our actions, but they can be soundly ignored as long as they are silent."

Bulganin then started stomping his feet while making dramatic hand gestures, exclaiming that, his ideology is, in fact, "the epitome of Anti-Revisionism". By comparing himself to Lenin and Stalin, he has managed to somewhat criticize his opponents.

As for Mikhail Suslov himself, he was promptly demoted from his position in the Central Committee, and was assigned to handle transportation affairs in Komi ASSR, banishing him forever from the relevant political circles in Perm."

No matter how much his mentor Mikhail Kalinin might have taught him, his inexperience was perfect for exploitation. With a few simple political maneuvers, Turkenich was tricked into taking responsibilities for previous failures during his time as a partisan leader.

 twrBULGANIN.13.t:0 "Soft Purges"
 twrBULGANIN.13.d:0 "At first, hardline old party members that refused to endorse Nikolai Bulganin were left alone due to their fame. However, with the atmosphere now favouring Bulganin's position, these old guards became a sort of annoyance for the administration.\n\nTherefore, in a "soft purge", most of these party members were sent a retirement request, essentially forcing them out of politics and then keeping their mouths shut with fancy medals and state pensions. Knowing that resistance is meaningless, all of these retirement offers were accepted, paving the war for a total Bulganin loyalist party."

According to the resolution passed by the Communist Party, Bulganin Thought encourages the Communist Party to remain flexible, but also warned the party of the danger of radical reforms. In terms of state, Bulganin Thought disapproves a western style multi-party system, exclaiming that the Soviet Union can only develop further under the leadership of the one party. However, it did state the potential of forming "sister political parties or groups" that could aid the Communist Party in listening to the opinions belonging to the many interest groups."

When the Soviet Union was absent from the region, these people managed to keep the economy afloat, kept the people from chaos and certain doom.\n\nWhile they might not deserve any praise for working with the enemy, it is certainly understandable. They worked for the people, and before the Soviet administration can begin the long process of regaining the Far East's trust, our first step should be reconciliation.

Mikhail Suslov also saw the value of having the group on his side, appointing a loyal ally as a replacement, effectively sparing the department from truly taking responsibilities of what they have committed under Lavrentiy Beria."
 twrSUSLOV.5.a:0 "Merkulov will be a great asset."

 twrSUSLOV.6.t:0 "The Collective Leadership"
 twrSUSLOV.6.d:0 "As a supporter of a Soviet collective leadership, Mikhail Suslov's now affirmed administration have established a token collective leadership.\n\nSharing power between three significant representatives, this twisted form of collective leadership is extremely loyal to the unquestionable role of Mikhail Suslov. This move will certainly be beneficial to the stability of the Communist Party, and provide a safe environment for the Soviet Union to recover from her wounds.\n\nLong live the Soviet Union."
 twrSUSLOV.6.a:0 "We are now in control."

 twrSUSLOV.7.t:0 "Voroshilov and Timoshenko"
 twrSUSLOV.7.d:0 "Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon Timoshenko were both influential marshals of the Soviet Union. But, their failures during the Great Patriotic War made them targets of political repression. And during the Kalinin Administration, Lavrentiy Beria successfully fabricated a case against the two, pinning most of the Red Army's mismanagement onto the two, in order to preserve face for the rest of the military.\n\nSince then, these two field marshals have been described by state media as "criminals of their misdeeds", only to be finally rehabilitated by the orders of Mikhail Suslov's Central Committee. The new official narrative now seeks to paint these two in a more neutral light, no longer obsessed with using them as scapegoats of complicated circumstances."
 twrSUSLOV.7.a:0 "Rest in peace, heroes."

 twrSUSLOV.8.t:0 "Military Troika"
 twrSUSLOV.8.d:0 "In an effort to balance the political aspect of the Red Army, Mikhail Suslov opted to manage the Red Army with the help of a Troika.\n\nIn this special Military Troika, Mikhail Suslov serves as "First Among Equals", with the two other members being Field Marshal Vasily Chuikov and Minister Vsevolod Merkulov. Together, this troika will determine the future of the Red Army and consult one another regarding its continuous development."
 twrSUSLOV.8.a:0 "A kingdom with three kings."

 twrSUSLOV.9.t:0 "Tenfold Initiative"
 twrSUSLOV.9.d:0 "Ordered by the Military Troika, the one and only solution to the German question is a significant expansion of force, an army that would be able to outnumber and outgun the invaders, hoping to achieved a "tenfold" increase in numbers.\n\nWith the same goal in mind, the troika has yet to decide on what should the Red Army spend their resources on. To accomplish this ambitious goal, the Soviet Union can either pay additional attention on the armoured forces, or rely on the reliable use of infantry power."
 twrSUSLOV.9.a:0 "Increase tank production!"
 twrSUSLOV.9.b:0 "Focus on infantry!"

 twrSUSLOV.10.t:0 "Fortress Cities"
 twrSUSLOV.10.d:0 "Being just a stone's throw away from enemy lines, Soviet cities on the frontline are faced with difficult challenges. In order to prepare these locations and their citizens for the conflicts ahead, the Central Committee has announced the plan to designate towns and cities near the front as "fortress cities", turning population centres into complicated networks of hardpoints and defensive complexes that would be tied into civilian lives.\n\nThe most notable example of this plan will be the city of Gorky, with the plan being a city that could defend itself even if it were to be located behind enemy lines."
 twrSUSLOV.10.a:0 "These strongholds will hold against the Germans!"

 twrSUSLOV.11.t:0 "The End of Revisionism"
 twrSUSLOV.11.d:0 "Beria's REP was a disaster for the Soviet people. Worst of all, there were too many people that were willing to cooperate with this foul decision. With much effort and convincing from Mikhail Suslov and his Central Committee, the final traces of revisionist practices have been wiped out within our territory.\n\nOf course, this task has yet to be fully completed, as portions of our land are still occupied by revisionist and fascist elements. But for whatever's under our control, revisionism shall be a memory of the past."
 twrSUSLOV.11.a:0 "Back on the left track."

 twrSUSLOV.12.t:0 "Dekulakization Yields Results"
 twrSUSLOV.12.d:0 "Just years ago, the Kalinin administration and the Beria administration allowed the return of the dreaded kulaks, rich "peasants" that owned large scale properties.\n\nThese vampires have no place in the USSR, and for this reason, the Central Committee has enacted swift justice against the new kulaks.\n\nWith their resources equally distributed to all peasants, according to local reports, the quality of life for all have generally improved."
 twrSUSLOV.12.a:0 "Land for the toilers!"

 twrSUSLOV.13.t:0 "Promoting "Rootless Cosmopolitanism""
 twrSUSLOV.13.d:0 "Perpetuated by the Agitprop but echoed by General Secretary Mikhail Suslov, the theory of Jewish intellectuals being "Unloyal to the Soviet Union" has once returned to the front row seat of Soviet political affairs.\n\nAccused of plotting the Union's demise and having connections with the bourgeoisie, several high profile Jewish intellectuals have been targeted, even condemned by the Communist Party."
 twrSUSLOV.13.a:0 "They cannot be trusted."

 twrSUSLOV.14.t:0 "Three Point Notice"
 twrSUSLOV.14.d:0 "-IZVESTIA, IMPORTANT NOTICE-\n\nEach and every proud citizen of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics must remember and remain ever absolute in the function of the three core values of Marxism-Leninism.\n1. Rejection of the cult of the individual - Self-perceived misfortune is a gross misconduct of the obligations of a Soviet citizen to the highest degree. All must understand the necessity of selfless actions in the process of forging a utopia for the future generations and for the prosperity of Communism.\n2. Rejection of the cult of skepticism - Any and all behaviours involving the questioning of any directions as given by the Central Committee and/or by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a gross misconduct of the obligations of a Soviet citizen to the highest degree. All directions announced on behalf of the workers and the state have all been approved by the citizenry of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics and thus are mandatory under the principle of democratic centralism. Failure to accept or questionable acceptance are in violation of the will of the common people.\n3. Total dedication to the previous two points - It is paramount for workers worldwide that each and every single citizen follow the previous points by all means necessary. Any encounter or suspected violation against the workers of the world must be reported to the appropriate authorities as designated by the respective regional Communist Party apparatus.\n\nSigned: Comrade Mikhail Andreyevich Suslov, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"
 twrSUSLOV.14.a:0 "Read them carefully, comrades!"

 twrSUSLOV.15.t:0 "Stalin's Last Note"
 twrSUSLOV.15.d:0 "In a rare case of declassification, the Communist Party has published a series of letters, supposedly written before Joseph Stalin died a heroic death in battle.\n\nIn these letters, Stalin criticized the leadership at the time, warning the Soviet Union of revisionist elements and asking everyone to stay alert against "class enemies from within". On another letter, Stalin had apparently written a list of names, stating that these are individuals that he would recommend to serve as the country's emergency leaders. Among these names, Vyacheslav Molotov and Mikhail Suslov both appeared, the two prominent figures of the current administration.\n\nFor the common folk, it is impossible to prove the authenticity of these documents, with the words of the party being the sole truth."
 twrSUSLOV.15.a:0 "This authentic document proves our legitimacy."

 twrSUSLOV.16.t:0 "De-Rehabilitate Malenkov"
 twrSUSLOV.16.d:0 "It is true that Lavrentiy Beria killed many innocent people, but Georgy Malenkov was not certainly one of them.\n\nRevisionist-in-chief of the his time, this technocrat wannabe would have steered the Soviet Union off her path if given the chance, similar to how Beria ruined the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.\n\nWith a swift motion to reinstate Malenkov's guilty status, the Party Congress was quick with its verdict, unamiously confirming that Malenkov was indeed, a traitor that deserved to be shot."
 twrSUSLOV.16.a:0 "That fat piece of crap deserved it."

 twrSUSLOV.17.t:0 "Executing the Neo-Whites"
 twrSUSLOV.17.d:0 "Formed by "volunteers" and organised by the central committee, patriot squads roamed the cities that were once considered hubs of the Russian Republic. Day and night, the squads dragged White traitors onto the street and then lynched, clearing out thousands of locations with brutal efficiency. After each successful execution, the traitors' bodies were put on display, equipped with a sign with "I am a Neo-White imperialist" written on it for the public to see."
 twrSUSLOV.17.a:0 "We will not tolerate foreign puppets!"

 twrSUSLOV.18.t:0 "Executing the Neo-Mensheviks"
 twrSUSLOV.18.d:0 "All of the "socialist" Soviet pretenders are not socialist. At best, they are social fascists, a relic of the Mensheviks.\n\nThese reborn Mensheviks will not be spared.\n\nOne by one, these fake socialists were rounded up, charged, and then executed. In a brutally efficient fashion, the Neo-Menshevik threat has been defeated."
 twrSUSLOV.18.a:0 "Social fascists will be purged!" 

 twrSUSLOV.101.t:0 "Increased Russification"
 twrSUSLOV.101.d:0 "The extent to which old separate national identities should be welcomed or seen as a hindrance to socialist unity has been a debate within the Soviet state ever since its founding. Following in the footsteps of Stalin, Suslov has decided that unity must be prioritised above all, and regional nationalities are nothing more than expressions of bourgeois chauvinism. The policy of Russification, of bringing all corners of the Soviet Union in line with a Russia-centric new Soviet culture, will be continued and accelerated, and the use of the Russian language will be enforced across the Union."
 twrSUSLOV.101.a:0 "Speak Russian."

 twrSUSLOV.19.t:0 "Red Army Dominance"
 twrSUSLOV.19.d:0 "The influence of the Red Army has peaked and is now dominating Soviet politics. This unchecked dominance might damage the administration's capabilities down the line."
 twrSUSLOV.19.a:0 "This might become a problem."

 twrSUSLOV.20.t:0 "Agitprop Dominance"
 twrSUSLOV.20.d:0 "The influence of the Agitprop has peaked and is now dominating Soviet politics. This unchecked dominance might damage the administration's capabilities down the line."

 twrSUSLOV.21.t:0 "Foreign Ministry Dominance"
 twrSUSLOV.21.d:0 "The influence of the Foreign Ministry has peaked and is now dominating Soviet politics. This unchecked dominance might damage the administration's capabilities down the line."

 twrSUSLOV.22.t:0 "The Peak of Suslov's Reign"
 twrSUSLOV.22.d:0 "The crowd cheered Mikhail Suslov's name and looked up to the balcony where Suslov stood with great anticipation.\n\nUnder Suslov's watchful eyes, the Soviet Union is finally stabilized. Of course, much like Stalin before him, Suslov has great plans for the reborn Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.\n\nAt that moment, it felt as if everything was achievable for Mikhail Suslov."
 twrSUSLOV.22.a:0 "The Union is unstoppable!"

 twrSUSLOV.23.t:0 "Reintegration of the Norilsk Communists"
 twrSUSLOV.23.d:0 "Earlier this afternoon, Mikhail Suslov issued a general amnesty for members of the Norilsk Communist Socialist Party. Its former leader, Leonid Brezhnev was even greeted by the General Secretary.\n\nMembers of the Norilsk Communist Socialist Party were invited to rejoin the Communist Party, and a selected few were even promoted to high positions. Suslov himself declared that the formation and actions of the Communist Socialist Party was "out of necessity", and that these politicians were "victims of Beria's tyrannical rule"."
 twrSUSLOV.23.a:0 "Misguided comrades rejoin our ranks."

 twrSUSLOV.24.t:0 "Lackluster Results, Famine"
 twrSUSLOV.24.d:0 "The results of our Great Surge Forward have been lackluster. Living conditions did not experience an increase, and at worst, the heavy industralization attempts have resulted in a famine in the countryside.\n\nA committee has been assigned to investigate this situation."
 twrSUSLOV.24.a:0 "There were some...errors."

 twrSUSLOV.241.t:0 "Challenged in the Central Committee"
 twrSUSLOV.241.d:0 "Due to the mismanagement of the Great Surge Forward, several members of the Central Committee have made soft yet open criticism of the mismanagement. Prominent committee member, Admiral Nikolai Kuznetsov mentioned that this suffering was "30% human failure, 70% natural causes", a statement that greatly upset Mikhail Suslov and his fellow hardliners. Regardless, while Kuznetsov himself is a fringe, the fact that little to none of Suslov's supposed allies stood up for him is a troubling sign."
 twrSUSLOV.241.a:0 "Are they trying to get rid of Suslov?"

 twrSUSLOV.242.t:0 "A Party Pacified"
 twrSUSLOV.242.d:0 "The troublesome members of the Central Committee have been either removed or appeased. With some convincing, Suslov's allies have also once again pledged their support for his administration, ending all threat of a possible internal coup."
 twrSUSLOV.242.a:0 "Back in control!"

 twrSUSLOV.25.t:0 "Mikhail Suslov Resigns"
 twrSUSLOV.25.d:0 "Hours ago, official Soviet statements have confirmed Mikhail Suslov's resignation.\n\nA known hardliner and Stalinist, former General Secretary Mikhail Suslov stepped down today due to personal reasons, stating that he is "no longer fit to rule due to fatigue". Another statement published by the Central Committee wished Suslov well and expressed appreciation for his leadership. After his retirement, state pensions will be provided to Suslov.\n\nDespite the official reasoning, experts suggest that this move was a result of pressure within the Communist Party, after the lackluster results of the Soviet Union's ambitious reconstruction plans."
 twrSUSLOV.25.a:0 "Another chapter."
 twrSUSLOV.25.b:0 "The hardliner is gone."
 twrSUSLOV.25.c:0 "Bolsheviks..."

 twrCHUIKOV.1.t:0 "The Military's Domination"
 twrCHUIKOV.1.d:0 "Throughout the government quarters, Red Army soldiers are guarding every corner.\n\nThe proper functions of the state have largely been handed over to the absolute control of the Red Army, a total subversion of the traditional role of the Communist Party had over the Red Army. Instead, the Red Army has now dominated the Party, the military's monopoly on violence has strong-armed the state into total submission.\n\nWith this new arrangement and in the name of security, emergency powers have been given to Marshal Vasily Chuikov. A parallel military government has been established, holding actual authority in the operation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics."
 twrCHUIKOV.1.a:0 "What do these bureaucrats know?"

 twrCHUIKOV.2.t:0 "Mandatory Military Training"
 twrCHUIKOV.2.d:0 "Every man, woman, child of the Soviet Union have been ordered to register in local military offices. Following the latest decree announced by the Red Army, every capable Soviet citizen is expected to complete a minimum of 3 weeks of military training. Marshal Vasily Chuikov insists that this solution is the only real answer to ensure state security and the survival of the Soviet Union."
 twrCHUIKOV.2.a:0 "The military must expand!"

 twrCHUIKOV.3.t:0 "Village Riots"
 twrCHUIKOV.3.d:0 "Unsatisfied by the Red Army Government's borderline tyrannical rule, individual villages are beginning to experience riots.\n\nIn these remote villages, the military usually take time to organise a proper response. But when the soldiers eventually arrive to the locations, brute force is enough to restore peace and order in the areas. However, in the case of Ryzhkovo, villagers armed themselves and attacked the Red Army reinforcements, resulting in 9 rebel fatalities and the death of a Red Army private."
 twrCHUIKOV.3.a:0 "Fire!"

 twrCHUIKOV.4.t:0 "Rural Black Market"
 twrCHUIKOV.4.d:0 "Goods and more high-end foodstuff are becoming increasingly inaccessible in the urban settlements. More and more Soviet urbanites are now offering goods and currencies to Soviet farmers in exchange for better quality foodstuff, such as meat and milk.\n\nMany of these farmers belong to a Sovkhoz or a Kolkhoz, but it seems that many farm administrators have somewhat accepted this practice. This black market continues to thrive, and as part of the Red Army's strategy to somewhat appease the population, authorities will tolerate but continue to monitor the situation."
 twrCHUIKOV.4.a:0 "We turn a blind eye."

 twrCHUIKOV.5.t:0 "Civilian Production Suspended"
 twrCHUIKOV.5.d:0 "With orders in immediate effect, most luxury goods production facilities will now be converted to military affairs. The production of civilian goods will now be an afterthought, and the entire industry shall be dedicated to the reunification effort."
 twrCHUIKOV.5.a:0 "For the greater good"

 twrCHUIKOV.6.t:0 "Local Uprisings"
 twrCHUIKOV.6.d:0 "Recently, more and more reports of village riots are being submitted. And worryingly, local Red Army headquarters are reporting a sharp increase of armed encounters with villagers.\n\nIt appears that many disloyal villages have armed themselves, with some even acquiring Maxim machine guns, inflicting heavy casualties on the Red Army columns. To counter this worsening unrest situation, local headquarters have began to permit the use of tanks and artillery to quell local uprisings"
 twrCHUIKOV.6.a:0 "Put them down!"

 twrCHUIKOV.7.t:0 "Anti-Soviet Revolt"
 twrCHUIKOV.7.d:0 "Instead of the usual reports of a handful of armed villagers causing trouble in a village, a much more disturbing development has occurred.\n\nEarlier today, a local Red Army forward operations base was attacked and captured. This supposedly special incident was followed by multiple reports of large scale rebellions. Many villages have formed compacts with other similarly disloyal villages, leading to the creation of an Anti-Soviet Coalition.\n\nThe Soviet Union is now facing an open, organised rebellion."
 twrCHUIKOV.7.a:0 "Destroy these traitors!"

 twrCHUIKOV.8.t:0 "Chuikov's Cult of Personality"
 twrCHUIKOV.8.d:0 "Marshal Vasily Chuikov loves us all. His iron wall stopped the German warmongers on their tracks, and his resolve saved the people from the selfish political elites.\n\nGlory to the Eternal Marshal! Glory to the Soviet Union!"
 twrCHUIKOV.8.a:0 "The Marshal loves us all."

 twrCHUIKOV.9.t:0 "The Inferior Party"
 twrCHUIKOV.9.d:0 "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is merely a political party. When it comes to the military, only the state and the people are above the military.\n\nIn this chain of command, the political unit should be below or equal to the military, as both of entities exist to serve the will of the people's state.\n\nNo longer will the party hold supremacy over the functions of the Red Army! With the safeguards set by the Chuikov government, this situation shall never occur!"
 twrCHUIKOV.9.a:0 "We answer to nobody but the people."

 twrCHUIKOV.10.t:0 "Saviour of the Soviet Union"
 twrCHUIKOV.10.d:0 "While the Marshal himself is not that fonded of flattery, he understands the necessity of these policies. His one and only goal is to bring the Soviet Union back, return it to the glorious state it once was. The path to salvation is long and painful, and the cult must serve as a much needed morale boost for such dark times.\n\nAcross Perm, political banners dominated the building walls, all repeating the same slogan...\n"Marshal Vasily Chuikov saved the Soviet Union! Without Marshal Vasily Chuikov, there will be no Soviet Union!""
 twrCHUIKOV.10.a:0 "He shall guide us to victory!"

 twrCHUIKOV.11.t:0 "Military Restores Order"
 twrCHUIKOV.11.d:0 "The unruly crowds must be stopped. While the government understands the disapproval, these necessary actions are committed for the sole great purpose - Unification of the Soviet Union.\n\nLives have been lost. But hopefully, in the history books, their deaths will not be in vain and our descendants will understand our necessary evil of today.\n\nAll in the name of a better tomorrow."
 twrCHUIKOV.11.a:0 "Unification comes first."

 twrCHUIKOV.12.t:0 "Soviet Progress"
 twrCHUIKOV.12.d:0 "Marshal Vasily Chuikov stood on the balcony, prepared to make a speech addressing the adoring crowd. His actions however, terrified some of his staff members. Chuikov discarded his speech script then started his address to the Soviet people.\n\n"Comrades, you all have performed excellently for the motherland. I know that times were rough and our policies were harsh, but knowing that the Union is finally unified today, gives me great strength to conclude that my measures were necessary."\nHe paused to look around, then after ten seconds of silence, he continued.\n"Many of our enemies are still at large, and the Red Army shall remain diligent against all possible threats. Very soon, the Red Army will complete their mission in safeguarding the revolution and transfer power back to civilian hands. The worst of times have passed...""
 twrCHUIKOV.12.a:0 ""...and now, the Union moves forward!""

 twrCHUIKOV.13.t:0 "Trial of the Commissars"
 twrCHUIKOV.13.d:0 "Since the Battle of Stalingrad, Chuikov witnessed first hand the behaviour of the political commissars. His distaste for the political interference in the Red Army grew, and barely tolerated their existence during the troublesome period of reunification.\n\nBut now, with all the false pretenders defeated, Chuikov has launched official enquiries on the actions of certain political commissars, promising retribution and justice for any mistreatment of Soviet soldiers on the frontline."
 twrCHUIKOV.13.a:0 "Criminals will answer for their crimes!"

 twrCHUIKOV.14.t:0 "Chuikov Resigns"
 twrCHUIKOV.14.d:0 "Surprisingly, Soviet military dictator Vasily Chuikov has resigned.\n\nInitially, Chuikov's tenure was marked by brutal policies and a personality cult. However, not long after the reunification of the Soviet Union, Vasily Chuikov made his intentions to restore civilian rule clear to the public, and has followed through with his promise today. In his place, Ivan Khokhlov and the Communist Party will resume their leadership of the Soviet Union, marking an uneventful end to Soviet military dictatorship.\n\nAs for Chuikov himself, he declared that he will still contribute to the Soviet Union, but this time as a professional military personnel instead of a politician."
 twrCHUIKOV.14.a:0 "A return to civilian rule!"
 twrCHUIKOV.14.b:0 "Interesting."
 twrCHUIKOV.14.c:0 "Another rat bastard!"

 twrSSRS.1.t:0 "Status of Byelorussia"
 twrSSRS.1.d:0 "Byelorussia, located west of the Russian core and north of Ukraine, is a clear core part of the greater Russian community. Under the Nazi occupation it saw among the worst destruction and suffering, and now that it has been liberated by us, it will be swiftly reintegrated into the Union with its necessary autonomy."
 twrSSRS.1.a:0 "Establish an ASSR!"
 twrSSRS.1.b:0 "Establish a SSR!"

 twrSSRS.2.t:0 "Status of Ukraine"
 twrSSRS.2.d:0 "After Russia itself, Ukraine had always been the most significant region of greater Russia and the Soviet Union, but under Nazi occupation it had been enslaved and exploited to feed the Reich. With it back under our control, we will reintegrate it into the Union with its necessary autonomy."
 
 twrSSRS.3.t:0 "Status of Georgia"
 twrSSRS.3.d:0 "Located on the western side of the southern Caucasus, Georgia had always been a rebellious region within the USSR, and as the Nazis swept into the Caucasus they allowed the creation of a puppet Georgian state. With this illegitimate creation destroyed and Georgia back under our control, we can reintegrate it into the USSR."
 
 twrSSRS.4.t:0 "Status of Armenia"
 twrSSRS.4.d:0 "Nestled in the middle of the southern Caucasus, Armenia was quite the distant frontier of Russian control in the south for a long time, and as the Nazis swept into the Caucasus they allowed the creation of a puppet Armenian state. With this illegitimate creation destroyed and Georgia back under our control, we can reintegrate it into the USSR."
 
 twrSSRS.5.t:0 "Status of Azerbaijan"
 twrSSRS.5.d:0 "The largest of the south Caucasian nations, Azerbaijan was seized by the Nazis for its precious oil wealth. Now that we have liberated the country from the yoke of Nazi colonialism, we can reintegrate it back into the USSR, and welcome back those Azerbaijanis who have remained loyal to the Soviet cause."

 twrSSRS.6.t:0 "Status of Kirghizstan"
 twrSSRS.6.d:0 "A mountainous nation right in the depths of Central Asia, the region of Kirghizstan was lost to Soviet control during the collapse of the USSR. With control over the region reestablished by our forces, we can reintegrate the region back into the Union with its necessary political autonomy."

 twrSSRS.7.t:0 "Status of Turkmenistan"
 twrSSRS.7.d:0 "A relatively sparsely populated nation in the far south west of Central Asia, the region of Turkmenistan was lost to Soviet control during the collapse of the USSR. With control over the region reestablished by our forces, we can reintegrate the region back into the Union with its necessary political autonomy."

 twrSSRS.8.t:0 "Status of Uzbekistan"
 twrSSRS.8.d:0 "The most populous of the Central Asian nations, the region of Uzbekistan was lost to Soviet control during the collapse of the USSR. With control over the region reestablished by our forces, we can reintegrate the region back into the Union with its necessary political autonomy."

 twrSSRS.9.t:0 "Status of Tajikistan"
 twrSSRS.9.d:0 "Located in the far south east of Central Asia, the region of Tajikistan was lost to Soviet control during the collapse of the USSR. With control over the region reestablished by our forces, we can reintegrate the region back into the Union with its necessary political autonomy."

 twrSSRS.10.t:0 "Status of Kazakhstan"
 twrSSRS.10.d:0 "Though sparsely populated, Kazakhstan has a huge and strategically important landmass, but as the Soviet Union collapsed, much of it was lost to Soviet control. With control over the region reestablished by our forces, we can reintegrate the region back into the Union with its necessary political autonomy."

 twrKUGO.1.t:0 "Sergei Kruglov's Radio Address"
 twrKUGO.1.d:0 "In Sergei Kruglov's radio address, he condemned many of Beria's personal actions on behalf of the Soviet government. However, Kruglov also made it clear that the path of reform is the correct one for the Soviet Union, stating that further economic and political reforms will go a long way in reunifying the shattered Soviet Union."
 twrKUGO.1.a:0 "Many mistakes were made, but we have learnt."

 twrKUGO.2.t:0 "The Responsibility List"
 twrKUGO.2.d:0 "On a special edition of the Pravda, Sergei Kruglov and his administration published a list of names, all of whom were mid to low level NKVD officers. In these articles, these officers were accused of committing most of the criminal acts of the Beria regime. Apparently, the list also included the murderer of Georgy Malenkov.\n\nThe government has promised swift disciplinary actions for these criminals."
 twrKUGO.2.a:0 "They were the criminals!"

 twrKUGO.3.t:0 "Formal Party Approval"
 twrKUGO.3.d:0 "Despite all our differences, the Communist Party have begrudgingly accepted our authority. However, knowing their hostility towards our government, it is only a matter of time until their shattered schemers reorganize against our administration.\n\nDuring this window of time, Kruglov's administration must do its utmost to earn the trust of the party."
 twrKUGO.3.a:0 "Work together."

 twrKUGO.4.t:0 "New Age Reformism"
 twrKUGO.4.d:0 "Reporting to the Communist Party, Sergei Kruglov has expressed his intentions in further reforms to the Soviet system. Kruglov also promised the optimization of the New Economic Policy, gathering much support from the reformist wing of the Communist Party."
 twrKUGO.4.a:0 "A change for the better is coming!"

 twrKUGO.5.t:0 "Reinforced Democratic Centralism"
 twrKUGO.5.d:0 "Democratic Centralism must be followed. Any agreement of the Communist Party, even if only passed by a slim majority, will be binding to all party members.\n\nWhile this practice was already enforced in the Communist Party long before Kruglov, the disapproval of the hardliners has resulted in the necessity of this reminder."
 twrKUGO.5.a:0 "Binding for all members!"

 twrKUGO.6.t:0 "De-Beriazation"
 twrKUGO.6.d:0 "Under a resolution passed by the Central Committee, references and imageries of Lavrentiy Beria will now be removed. Despite the fact that the NKVD opposed the plotters for their harsh actions against Lavrentiy Beria, the administration has backtracked and silently approved their decision to eliminate Beria.\n\nThis backtracking seems to be one of the administration's many policies of reconciliation."
 twrKUGO.6.a:0 "This rapist deserved his death!"

 twrKUGO.7.t:0 "Central Committee Meeting"
 twrKUGO.7.d:0 "Sergei Kruglov has called for a special session of the Central Committee. In this session, matters regarding political reforms will be raised, and this major talking point is expected to be addressed."
 twrKUGO.7.a:0 "Let the work begin!"

 twrKUGO.8.t:0 "Presidium Reforms"
 twrKUGO.8.d:0 "The first proposal was regarding the reformation of the Soviet Presidium. Proposed by Nikolai Kuznetsov and apparently supported by Kruglov himself, these reforms call for a system of "President of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics" to replace the collective Presidium and head of Presidium system.\n\nUnder this proposal, power would hypothetically be more balanced, and pave way for a more law-based constitutional rule."
 twrKUGO.8.a:0 "Approved! Move ahead!"
 twrKUGO.8.b:0 "Stop the idea from reaching the table."

 twrKUGO.81.t:0 "Miscellaneous Debates"
 twrKUGO.81.d:0 "With nothing of importance being discussed, this special session failed to achieve any expected political reforms."
 twrKUGO.81.a:0 "Productive procrastination."

 twrKUGO.9.t:0 "A President for the Soviet Union"
 twrKUGO.9.d:0 "The first President of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics will be a historic figure for Soviet history. While the committee has agreed to go through with the plan, the matter of who should be the first is still up to debate."
 twrKUGO.9.a:0 "Kruglov nominates himself."
 twrKUGO.9.b:0 "Kruglov wishes to take a step back."

 twrKUGO.10.t:0 "President Reform Drafted"

 twrKUGO.10.a:0 "Approved!"

 twrKUGO.11.t:0 "Picking a Candidate"
 twrKUGO.11.d:0 "With Sergei Kruglov declining to be a candidate, the Central Committee is free to decide who should serve as the first president."

 twrKUGO.12.t:0 "The Main Debate"
 twrKUGO.12.d:0 "Matters of liberalization were also raised during this meeting. This topic was controversial, and conservative members fought hard to get the government to do as little as possible in this regard.

He is rumoured to be a close asset of Sergei Kruglov, and will continue to serve as the mouthpiece of the NKVD clique."

 twrKUGO.15.d:0 "As the product of some strange political reforms in the Soviet Union, the post of "President of the Soviet Union" now exists.\n\nIn a strange twist of fate, the First Soviet President is Polina Zhemchuzhina, wife of the prominent Soviet diplomat, Vyacheslav Molotov. It is currently unclear how this hardliner will fair under a reformist regime."

 twrKUGO.16.t:0 "Soviet President Podgorny"
 twrKUGO.16.d:0 "As the product of some strange political reforms in the Soviet Union, the post of "President of the Soviet Union" now exists.\n\nThe First Soviet President is Nikolai Podgorny, a relatively unknown figure both abroad and within the Soviet Union.

 twrKUGO.17.t:0 "Anti-Corruption Initiative"
 twrKUGO.17.d:0 "According to NKVD reports, corruption is becoming increasingly apparent in the state apparatus. With the administration attempting to appease all sides, [ROOT.GetLeader] has launched anti-corruption initiatives, assigning several committees to combat the matter."

 twrKUGO.18.d:0 "Sergei Kruglov made his first appearance after the reunification.

 twrKUGO.18.a:0 "The hardliners trembled."

 twrKUGO.19.t:0 "Grand Reforms"
 twrKUGO.19.d:0 "Even more ambitious than before, the Grand Reforms plan to completely overhaul the Soviet system of goverance. Notably, the mention of "independent opposition" and "national self-determination" appeared multiple times in the proposal.\n\nTo the established members of the Communist Party, this proposal is a declaration of war, and it seems Kruglov is resorting to populist tactics to cling onto power."
 twrKUGO.19.a:0 "Change!"

 twrKUGO.20.t:0 "Union of Soverign Socialist Republics"
 twrKUGO.20.d:0 "In an extremely surprising turn of events, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have transformed into the Union of Soverign Socialist Republics. This change was approved by the pacified Communist Party, and it seems that this is the most grand attempt at granting associated republics with higher authority within the Union.\n\nPolitical experts are scrambling to find a logical explanation of this reform."
 twrKUGO.20.a:0 "USSR into USSR!"
 twrKUGO.20.b:0 "How is this going to work?"
 twrKUGO.20.c:0 "What?"

 twrKUGO.21.t:0 "Party Turmoil"
 twrKUGO.21.d:0 "As expected, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is now openly condemning the actions of Sergei Kruglov. It is assumed that within the upcoming days, the opposition will mobilze and start the process of deposing Kruglov."
 twrKUGO.21.a:0 "Progress will not be stopped!"

 twrKUGO.22.t:0 "Opposition Mobilizes"
 twrKUGO.22.d:0 "The day has arrived and the opposition has made their move.\n\nSergei Kruglov has been placed under house arrest and the Central Committee convened without his presence. After a swift motion, the Central Committee ousted Sergei Kruglov from all positions of power and declared the formation of a transitional committee. Of course, the Red Army might stop this coup attempt, and the Red Army command decides to..."
 twrKUGO.22.a:0 "Support the coup."
 twrKUGO.22.b:0 "Support Kruglov."

 twrKUGO.23.t:0 "Conservative Coup in the USSR"
 twrKUGO.23.d:0 "Intimidated by Sergei Kruglov's promise of democratic reforms, the Central Committee of the Communist Party has launched a coup against the reformist regime.\n\nSergei Kruglov has been placed under house arrest and a transitional government has been declared."
 twrKUGO.23.a:0 "There will be corrections!"
 twrKUGO.23.b:0 "Worrying development."
 twrKUGO.23.c:0 "Good, let them infight."

 twrKUGO.24.t:0 "General Strike"
 twrKUGO.24.d:0 "Following the news of Kruglov's house arrest, thugs and crowds led by the illegal Party for the Democratization of Russia have occupied the streets in a general strike.

 twrKUGO.25.t:0 "The Final Straw"

 twrKUGO.25.b:0 "Revolution!"

 twrKUGO.26.t:0 "PDR Revolution in the USSR"
 twrKUGO.26.d:0 "In a strange twist of fate, a successful democratic revolution just occurred in Russia.\n\nLed by the PDR, formerly a democratic liberal terrorist organization active across the whole of Russia, this weird group has successfully deposed the Communist government. This baffling turn of events appeared to be impossible, but it is speculated that the secret aid from the Kruglov administration has allowed this revolution to transpire."
 twrKUGO.26.a:0 "Freedom! Democracy! Bread!"
 twrKUGO.26.b:0 "Will this regime last?"
 twrKUGO.26.c:0 "They will fall, soon."

 twrKUGO.27.t:0 "PDR "Disbands""
 twrKUGO.27.d:0 "As a democratic state, a dominant party system will only doom Russia. Therefore, under this principle, PDR has willingly announced their dissolution, transforming into three political parties with different ideological goals.\n\nSome however, have raised skepticism towards this development calling all three political parties "PDR plants"."
 twrKUGO.27.a:0 "We are a multi-party state...right?"

 twrKUGO.28.t:0 "Duma Elects President"
 twrKUGO.28.d:0 "In a unique electoral system, the State Duma will be the only body qualified to elect the president. In the first ever election, the three major parties made their bids, hoping to lead democratic Russia in accordance to their party manifestos."
 twrKUGO.28.a:0 "The Liberals carry!"
 twrKUGO.28.b:0 "The Social Democrats carry!"

According to the evidence, the timing between Stalin's evacuation column leaving provisional capital Kuybyshev for new provisional capital Perm match the period where the Germans launched a great offensive on Semyon Timoshenko's Volga Front. During this period of chaos, Luftwaffe bombing greatly intensified and German forces got extremely close to Kuybyshev. Furthermore, the estimated route of Stalin's secret evacuation crossed into a frontline battlefield between German spearhead columns and the Volga Red Army at the time, providing more ground for the "Killed in Battle" theory, suggesting that Stalin's security details joined the fight and served on the front, but Stalin was one of the many souls that were killed by German bombardment. His corpse is most likely cremated to avoid German discovery."
 STALINFATE.1.d_heros_death:0 "After an exhaustive period of investigation, our intelligence officers have reached an authoritative conclusion regarding Joseph Stalin's true fate.\n\nWhile our original estimation was correct, it was only partially correct. Stalin was not only killed in the heat of battle; he died when fighting the Germans. Intelligence officers tracked down an eyewitness, a survivor of a battle in the Kazan countryside. He recalled the fact that a group of elite guardsmen joined their exhausted unit and were led by a man that looked remarkably similar to Joseph Stalin. Apparently, this elite unit managed to drive the local German Waffen-SS unit back, and Joseph Stalin himself led the charge, but was unfortunately mortally wounded by a Nazi sniper. While some soldiers carried the General Secretary to safety, Stalin's wounds were untreatable due to the lack of medical supplies. Before his death, Stalin instructed the men to cremate his body and never speak of this incident again.\n\nFor the sake of confidentiality, the survivor remains unnamed in the reports."
 STALINFATE.1.d_realist_explain:0 "After an exhaustive period of investigation, our intelligence officers have reached an authoritative conclusion regarding Joseph Stalin's true fate.\n\nWhile the original guess of killed in battle is technically truthful, our intelligence officers have painted a far less glamorous narrative. When Stalin's security column evacuated from Kuybyshev, German air raids were incredibly frequent. Based on the remains and actual recovered evidences on a road near Chelno-Vershiny, Stalin's column was attacked and decimated by a Luftwaffe air raid, leaving most, if not all of the personnel involved dead. They further concluded that Stalin's corpse was most likely "burnt to crisp" in the back of a destroyed truck, explaining why a corpse and Stalin's personal belongings were never recovered."
 STALINFATE.1.d_logical_explain:0 "After an exhaustive period of investigation, our intelligence officers have reached an authoritative conclusion regarding Joseph Stalin's true fate.\n\nWhen the German advance columns approached, Stalin's evacuation column was devastated by the Luftwaffe. With the fear of German soldiers reaching their position and the fear of being captured alive, Joseph Stalin and his personal secretary committed suicide. Due to the fact that their communications equipment were destroyed, by the time of their suicide, they were unaware of the fact that the Red Army had successfully stop the German advance. Afterwards, the bodies were cremated and the remainder of Stalin's security details either rejoined the front or committed suicide."
 STALINFATE.1.d_degrading_explain:0 "After an exhaustive period of investigation, our intelligence officers have reached an authoritative conclusion regarding Joseph Stalin's true fate.\n\nAccording to eyewitness accounts, Joseph Stalin's column was scattered by the Luftwaffe. As a result, Joseph Stalin and his men went into hiding, and during months of hiding and attempting to avoid the Germans, Stalin died of health complications, probably from diseases developed during the poor living conditions in hiding."

However, as the outcome of the war became increasingly grim, Suslov performed a series of political maneuvers, allowing him to be extracted and recalled to serve as a member of the Orgburo and later, the Secretariat.\n\nSuslov would lay low during the unstable leaderships of Malenkov and Kalinin, gradually aligning himself with the hardliners of the party. And after a failed coup against Lavrentiy Beria's rise to power, Suslov chose to stay in Perm and filled the power vacuum, forming an ad-hoc alliance with Beria and wiggled his way to the leadership position of the hardliner faction. While this alliance is beneficial for political stability, the two partners are constantly against one another due to policy disagreements.§!"
 ALT_BERIA_DESC:0 "§YLavrentiy Beria§!\n------------------\n§gLeader of the regime and the NKVD, Lavrentiy Beria needs no introduction. Beria has played his character well to fit into both sides of the party, from his reign of terror under Stalin and Kalinin to his now "reformist" character, Beria has morphed the NKVD into his own loyal clique, proponent of a shapeless form of Soviet ideology unique from any other.§!"
 Sergei_Kruglov_DESC:0 "§YSergei Kruglov§!\n------------------\n§gA powerful commissar during the German-Soviet War, Sergei Kruglov served as the Deputy Chief of the NKVD. His true allegiance was never revealed and he maintained a low profile since Joseph Stalin's demise.\n\nBut after Lavrentiy Beria was removed from power, Sergei Kruglov finally took over the People's Commissar of Internal Affairs, effectively assuming the role of leader for the NKVD faction.§!"
 Vyacheslav_Molotov_DESC:0 "§YVyacheslav Molotov§!\n------------------\n§gMinister of Foreign Affairs, Vyacheslav Molotov was thoroughly disgraced by the defeat of the German-Soviet War and the disintegration of Stalin's government, reducing him into an insignificant player at Perm.\n\nVyacheslav Molotov eventually lost his leadership position of the Stalinist-Hardliner orthodoxist faction to the Mikhail Suslov, at the time a rising star within the Communist Party. But, now with Suslov's embarassing failure against Lavrentiy Beria, Molotov has once again assumed the leadership, now leading a much weaker political force.§!"
 Semyon_Ignatyev_DESC:0 "§YSemyon Ignatyev§!\n------------------\n§gCurrently Minister of Security Affairs, Ignatyev benefited greatly from Stalin's Great Purge. He ascended the ranks of the Communist Party quickly, filling the void left by purged politicians. Initially serving in Moscow, he was promoted to serve as the First Secretary of the Buryat-Mongolian Republic. Soon after the start of the Kalinin Administration, Ignatyev was once again assigned special duties in the provisional capital of Perm. He was appointed to handle security affairs in the central party, gradually building connections with the Reformist faction, becoming an ally of Nikolai Bulganin.§!"
 Vsevolod_Merkulov_DESC:0 "§YVsevolod Merkulov§!\n------------------\n§gA former member of Lavrentiy Beria's "Georgian mafia", Merkulov had serious experience in the field of intelligence prior to his rise in power. In 1941, he was made leader of the People's Commissariat for State Security, but was heavily overshadowed by the duties and the state's reliance on the NKVD. But, despite his ties to Beria, Merkulov joined the faction that would eventually overthrow Beria's reformist regime, establishing close ties with the Suslov faction. His efforts yielded great results, as the new administration would promote Merkulov to the position of NKVD leadership, effectively making him the de-facto leader of two separate departments, both loyal to the Orthodoxist ideal.§!"

Grechko remained loyal during the exodus of military staff, successfully preserving himself amidst the troubling period.\n\nRemaining under the radar until Mikhail Suslov's rise, Grechko was placed in charge of the Red Army's political affairs, becoming Chuikov's public face in the collective leadership system.§!"
 Vasily_Moskovsky_DESC:0 "§YVasily Moskovsky§!\n------------------\n§gSince 1926, Vasily Moskovsky has served as an officer within the Red Army, with his profession being specialized in political warfare.

 TURKENICH_PUPPET:0 "Like a puppet on a thousand strings, Ivan Turkenich is no longer a leader of free will. Serving as the mouthpiece of the revolution and a pretty face for the party.\n\nReduced to a symbolic figurehead of a powerful collective leadership commanding in the shadow, Ivan Turkenich's authority has been fully usurped. He is now nothing but another Mikhail Kalinin, a withering man that everyone has learnt to not take seriously."
 Alexander_Poskrebyshev_DESC:0 "Alexander Nikolaevich Poskrebyshev is a long time Communist Party functionary. His peers have described him as hard working and Poskrebyshev served the former General Secretary Joseph Stalin with great dedication. However, Pokryshev was sidelined during the Kalinin period, and his influence evaporated upon Beria's rise to power.\n\nDuring this time, he accepted his new reality and continued to be somewhat active in politics, working under the radar on the side of the hardliners. Unexpectedly, Beria's palace coup would once again bring Pokryshev back to the center of political power, being elected by the Central Committee to serve as General Secretary."
 LEADER_Leonid_Brezhnev_DESC:0 "First sentenced by Lavrentiy Beria to rot in the Norillag, Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev's political life is more than legendary.\n\nFirst serving as a political commissar in the Great Patriotic War, Leonid Brezhnev caught the attention of the party and recieved quick promotions during early period of Perm government. However, as Kalinin's authority evaporated under the Malenkov-Beria diarchy, Brezhnev was targeted by Beria, resulting in his imprisonment in Norillag. However, during the chaotic period of Yeniseysk democracy, Brezhnev became the dominant figure of the syncretic party of Norilsk Communist Socialist Party. While his party reached out to the reactionaries, Brezhnev himself remained a dedicated Marxist. He was eventually rehabilitated by Mikhail Suslov and promoted to high positions within the government, leading to this mythical rise to the top."
 LEADER_Mikhail_Pervukhin_DESC:0 "Mikhail Georgievich Pervukhin originally served as a deputy and a minister in the Stalin administration. Pervukhin contributed to the war effort and other military affairs by serving as Minister of Chemical Industry, and made himself a prominent hardliner conservative member in the Perm government.\n\nWhile his power stagnated during the Kalinin-Malenkov-Beria period, the rise of Mikhail Suslov allowed Pervukhin to rise in power and influence. His war efforts have also led to him having closer ties with certain hardliner military leaders, making him the perfect face of a military-dominated collective leadership after Suslov."
 LEADER_Ivan_Khokhlov_DESC:0 "A soldier turned politician, Ivan Sergeyevich Khokhlov served in local district-level communist governments before entering the heart of power. In 1938, Kholkoz entered the Supreme Soviet, and in 1940, he became the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Russian SFSR. He became involved with the Military Council of Western Front, where Kholkoz served in the capacity of a quartermaster and focused on handling military logistics. After the relocation to Perm however, Kholkoz briefly resumed his duty as Premier of the Russian SFSR before being relocated to serve in the Ministry of Trade. After a handful of years without much political importance, Kholkoz's background made him a desirable candidate for Chuikov's transitional rule, a perfect bridge between statesmen and military."
 Nikolai_Kuznetsov_DESC:0 "A famous Soviet admiral, Nikolay Gerasimovich Kuznetsov is a war hero. During the first stages of the Great Patriotic War, his actions as the Minister of the Navy saved the Soviet fleet from complete destruction. Despite the deteriorating situation of the war, Kuznetsov maintained command cohesion and organised a stiff resistance towards the Kriegsmarine.\n\nIn the aftermath of the relocation to Perm and Stalin's disappearance, Kuznetsov retained his positions as Minister of the Navy. Eventually, as Perm's dependence on the military grew, Kuznetsov gained influence in party leadership, becoming a somewhat esteemed speaker of the reformist wing, publishing several articles criticizing the party's interference in military affairs and the state's lack of dedication to legal procedures. And finally, Kuznetsov emerged as a victorious black horse of the Communist Party, being the admiral-leader that most might not have expected."
 Viktor_Abakumov_DESC:0 "A career NKVD officer, Viktor Semyonovich Abakumov was originally a member of the Joint State Political Directorate but was seen as unfit to becoming a Chekist. However, by 1934, the reorganization turned Abakumov into a member of the NKVD. Abakumov worked in multiple departments within the NKVD, from the 1st Section of Economics Department, Chief Directorate of Camps and Labour Colonies (GULAG), to eventually his most powerful job yet, working as head of a section in the Main Directorate of State Security. Abakumov assisted with Joseph Stalin's Great Purge, and soon became the head of the NKVD unit of the Rostov Oblast. Abakumov returned to Moscow HQ on 12 February 1941 as a Senior Major of State Security and, after the reorganization and creation of the new NKGB, he became one of the deputies of Lavrentiy Beria. During the war, he reported directly to Joseph Stalin, but soon forged new connections with Lavrentiy Beria and Sergei Kruglov. Abakumov entrenched himself in the web of complicated allegiances within the state security apparatus, becoming a prime candidate of the influential agencies."
 Polina_Zhemchuzhina_DESC:0 "Polina Semyonovna Zhemchuzhina is a politician and wife of Vyacheslav Molotov. She  Zhemchuzhina was the director of the Soviet national cosmetics trust from 1932 to 1936, Minister of Fisheries in 1939, and head of textiles production in the Ministry of Light Industry from 1939 to 1950. Her career was greatly effected by her husband's fall from grace and eventual obscurity. However, Zhemchuzhina correctly involved herself in Krugolav era politics, currying favor in the newly formed conservative wing. Much like her husband, Zhemchuzhina is a staunch Stalinist and a believer of revolutionary practices. Her personality and unique position quickly made her the leader of the new hardliners.\n\nMost importantly, as a female politician, Zhemchuzhina's ultimate rise was a result of both progressive gesturing and a triumphant for the hardliners."
 Nikolai_Podgorny_DESC:0 "Unremarkable and largely unknown, Nikolai Viktorovich Podgorny is one of the many Ukrainian Communist officials that have fled to Perm. While he was quite influential in the Ukrainian SSR government, these power and positions were largely meaningless, due to the fact that the Ukrainian SSR only existed on paper. Eventually however, after the flight of the Second Union, Podgorny became the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine.\n\nPodgorny remained largely powerless in his time as First Secretary of the CPU, and with his only achievement being a comprehensive yet hypothetical reconstruction plan of the Ukrainian SSR. Regardless of this status of political limbo, Podgorny was soon elevated to the Central Government with Kruglov's blessing, as he saw the dire need of a proper Communist Party functionary as an ally."

In 1941, he was made leader of the People's Commissariat for State Security, but was heavily overshadowed by the duties and the state's reliance on the NKVD. And as the NKVD's rule entrenched, Vsevolod Merkulov expanded his influence within the departments. Merkulov remained very close to Lavrentiy Beria, becoming a close advisor of the administration.\n\nAnd when Lavrentiy Beria willingly stepped aside, Vsevolod Merkulov was the obvious candidate, representing a new face for the same elite influence."

 Pyotr_Masherov_DESC:0 "Pyotr Mironovich Masherov is a man that has experienced and shaped history. Born in 1919, Masherov's early life was one of the harsh poverty of the Civil War, and Masherov was forced to become the head of the family at an early age after his father's arrest and death during the Great Purge. But it was not long before he overcame the odds, becoming a teacher in his hometown.\n\nWhen the Germans invaded, Masherov volunteered, and was soon captured along with his mother. While en route to certain death in Germany, however, Masherov jumped out of the train along with his mother, and made his way back home, where he organised the first cells of what would become the massive Belarusian partisan movement. Masherov, working with Ponomarenko, Mazurov, and his own men, fought through thick and thin, and led during the long years after the fall of Moscow. His tenacity proved to win out in the end, for eventually, the Russians returned, bringing with them liberation from the fascist occupation.\n\nMasherov proved himself to be a close ally of comrade Turkenich - no surprise, given both were partisan men - and quickly rose through the ranks in the reborn union. Sidelining the revisionist elements who sought to bring the dear leader in line with their own treacherous views, Masherov was seen as the heir presumptive to the General Secretary - something that proved true with the latter's resignation. Now, Pyotr Mironovich is the boss once more - this time, not as a soldier, but as a politician."
 LEADER_Ivan_Turkenich_DESC:0 "A former partisan and a leader of the "Young Guard" resistance organization, Ivan Turkenich fought against the German authorities in occupied Krasnodon. For a few years, Turkenich successfully performed hit and run raids against German patrols and expanded the "Young Guard". But, German authorities eventually discovered the plot and arrested the majority of its leadership. Turkenich narrowly escaped German prosecutions, fleeing to Soviet held territories as a national hero.\n\nDuring Mikhail Kalinin's adminstration, Ivan Turkenich took advantage of the Soviet power vacuum, becoming a trusted ally of the regime and Kalinin's protege. Turkenich rapidly rose through the ranks of the Communist Party, eventually becoming the face of the Union's "Kalininist Faction", successfully dodging the numerous purges and political fights within the establishment.\n\nNow as the leader of the Soviet Union, Ivan Turkenich can finally realise plans of bringing about a union in Mikhail Kalinin's dreams."

 LEADER_Nikolai_Bulganin_DESC:0 "Formerly served as the chief political commissar on the Western Front under Marshal Timoshenko, Nikolai Bulganin worked under similar capacity throughout the leaderships of Stalin, Malenkov, and Kalinin.\n\nHowever, after Lavrentiy Beria assumed the leadership position, a power vacuum allowed Bulganin to greatly advance his political career, becoming the leader of a reformist wing of the Communist Party. Due to his formlessness in terms of political beliefs, Lavrentiy Beria allied Bulganin, promoting Bulganin to the position of ministership and a sitting member of the Politburo.\n\nAs of now, Bulganin has managed to win the ultimate prize of securing the premiership, gaining the full authority to enact his reformist ideals."

 Vasily_Chuikov_DESC:0 "Before the war, Vasily Chuikov functioned as the Soviet military attache to the Republic of China. Once the German-Soviet War broke out, Chuikov was recalled and placed in charge of a sector of the frontline.\n\nWhile the Soviets continued to retreat further and further into the interior, Chuikov earned fame by holding the northern flank of Gorky, even when Georgy Zhukov took most of the credit for winning the battle.\n\nBut after the mass exodus of Red Army officials to the pretender government, Chuikov became a valuable asset of the Perm government, promoted to the position of Marshal of the Soviet Union, while harbouring a great distaste for the dysfunctional Soviet system."
