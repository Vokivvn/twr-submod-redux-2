POLITICS_NARAYAN_DESC:0 "The only way for a system of oppression to be defeated is for the oppressed to become conscious of their own situation, and gather enough power to pose a true and existential threat towards their oppressor. \n\nThat is the core belief of Jayaprakash Narayan, and through his leadership, he wishes to contribute towards its realization in India. Growing up during the British colonial period, Narayan, like countless others, gained first-hand knowledge on the brutality of colonialism and imperialism. By the age of 20, he set out for America in order to further his university education, and it was in America where he would learn about the two things that would prove to define his political career. The first was the extent of proletarian suffering under capitalism, which was knowledge he gained in attempting to support himself and his studies. The second was the science and discipline of Marxism, which he gained through Das Kapital, and witnessing the success of the socialist revolution in Russia, at least until it was suppressed by the Germans. He would return to India in 1929, with a new revolutionary understanding and purpose. \n\nOn his return to India, he became heavily committed to the nationalist movement, having been jailed for civil disobedience in 1932. Upon his release from prison, he became General Secretary of the newly formed Congress Socialist Party, and as Britain was humiliated by the Germans in Europe, the cracks of its own colonial system in Asia became apparent. Violent uprisings appeared throughout the country, and the British man took the first boat back to London, leaving behind a broken people and many puppet princes in the south. \n\nBut now the fire has died down, and the Socialists under Narayan have won the 1952 elections, with just as many questions to answer as before. Will the new red India attempt to revive the spirit of the Soviet Union, or will it seek guidance in the pacifist ideals of Gandhi? What is to be done with the southern traitors, or the Chinese? How will the country move on from the war for independence? Only time will tell."
Ne_Win_DESC:0 "Ne Win was born in the early 1910s to a rare middle class of Burmese society. Attending Rangoon University in aspiration to become a doctor, and later expelled, he joined various intellectualist groups which became critical of British dominance over the country. By 1940 this had been achieved with the British withdrawal following Germany's shocking successes and Win's rival and former associate U Nu took power with the aid of a reluctant monarch. Win saw Nu's politics as traitorous to the Brumese people and quickly split from his moderate position to form the Burmese Socialist Programme Party around more hardline Maxist-Leninist ideology. Having alienated himself from other Burmese politicians with his radical ideals and unwilling to tie his fate to the collapsing Soviet order, Ne Win instead seeks the gruelling path of autarky for the Burmese people. Whilst critics deem his isolationism to all but his Indian allies as needlessly destructive and his economic goals as doomed to fail, a loyal section of the people seek to uphold his \"Burmese Way to Socialism\" and may yet see it realised."
POLITICS_ZAHEER_DESC:0 "Syed Sajjad Zaheer began his life in simple circumstances and rose to become a prominent Urdu author in the early 20th Century. Born under British occupation in 1905, Zaheer quickly put his literary talents to use writing a series of politically charged essays and novels putting focus on issues of Indian nationalism and Marxist ideology. The stirring situation of the time following the Great War led to him and several others forming the Progressive Writer's Movement to coordinate progressive intellectuals, though was soon banned by British authorities. Originally associated with the Communist Party of India during the days of the Raj, he immigrated to the newly created Pakistan following Britain's rushed exit from the subcontinent and helped found the Communist Party of Pakistan in order to push for a socialist state. Though grateful to his Indian allies who aided his ascent to the presidency it is widely known that Zaheer plans to construct Pakistan as a new and separate nation in its own right based on the values of social justice, anti-imperialism and socialism."
POLITICS_DESAI_DESC:0 "India's greatest strength has been the longevity of its traditions, while its greatest weakness has been its lack of contact with the outside world. If India seeks to win her place in the sun, she must open like a flower in spring. \n\nThat is the basic philosophy of Morarji Desai, and now that he is leader of India, he will work tirelessly to realize it. Born in what was formerly the Bombay Presidency, Desai was the oldest of eight other children and grew up in a modest household. After completing his university education in Mumbai and joining the civil service, he was inspired by the Gandhian struggle for independence. Fighting in the liberation war, he managed to become leader of the conservative faction of the Indian National Congress, opposed to both the ultranationalism of Bose and the socialism of Narayan. Now that the dust has settled over India, Desai is ready to put free market principles and open diplomacy to work. \n\nBut even now, there remain several unanswered questions. What is to be done with the south and Kashmir? Should India look to the British or to the Americans as fellows in democracy? How can Gandhi's ideals be used to help the economy? No one knows for sure, but Desai sits that his, with naught but a pen."

twrindia.0.t:0 "A Shattered Nation" ###check for lore and grammar
twrindia.0.d:0 "India is a broken nation. For hundreds of years, the subcontinent was subject to brutal imperialism. The idea of Indian nationalism was just sprouting, and so were her most loyal advocates. British colonial bureaucracy was a gargantuan machine, one dying under its own weight. So when the British left to fight their own war in Europe, a power vacuum of unheard scales formed. Every minor politician and civil servant with a claim to leadership scrambled for power. In the south, many of the existing princely structures flooded to fill in the English cavity. \n\nIn the north, Indian nationalists saw their chance. Subhas Chandras Bose, returning from the Soviet Union, declared a new Indian Republic. Disparate groups, from authoritarians to leftists, flocked around his ideal of an independent, democratic India. \n\nThe Indian Republic is still a fragile and new democracy. After disputes with Bengali regionalists, Bengali political groups coalesced into a new socialist group that declared independence, driving the Republic into greater division. In the south, an even greater threat has formed. Radical Hindu nationalist Vinayak Savarkar leads a revolt in the name of Hindutva.\n\nClouding it all is the Great Indian Famine. Instability after the British withdrawal has left lower classes agitated. Bread prices are sky-high, and a large portion of the population cannot feed themselves.\n\nIt is the perfect storm. Subhas Chandras Bose looks upon a broken India. As the 1952 Elections approach, he asks himself;"
twrindia.0.a:0 "Can he mend it?"
twrindia.1.t:0 "Victory in the South!"
twrindia.1.d:0 "Our forces in the south report that Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has been defeated. Though sporadic fighting continues, this is a clear victory for the Republic, and the south is now secure!"

twrindia.2.t:0 "Ending the War"
twrindia.2.d:0 "Our war for independence has gone on for years and both us and the government in Delhi are exhausted. With the nationalists in the south having seized a huge amount of ground, now may the best opportunity to achieve our nationhood. We should send overtures to Delhi, to ask for a truce, both so that we can achieve our independence and so the RSS can be crushed."
twrindia.2.a:0 "Send the offer"
twrindia.2.b:0 "Never!"
twrindia.3.t:0 "Bengal Offers Peace"
twrindia.3.d:0 "With our Republic under Bose pursuing a policy of Indian Unification since it freedom from British rule, we have fought against the creation of an independent Bengali state for several years. However, the front war in the east has been costly and exhausting for both sides, especially as the nationalists in the south pose a perhaps greater concern.\n\nAs a result, Bengal's self-declared government has contacted us offering a truce. Some say that we cannot accept further disintegration of India, that we must unify our nation with force, while others push for accepting the truce in order to concentrate on internal stability and crushing the RSS in the south. How shall we proceed?"

twrindia.6.d:0 "We knew from the start that the peace agreement with signed with India wouldnt last long. With their fight against the R.S.S. in the South, we had the chance to alleviate them from an another militant front. But now with the R.S.S. long gone and the Bose administration being harsher in regards to the idea of Indian Unification, we have been given an official ultimatum. We either submit to India and become an autonomous puppet state under their iron fist or we deny their demands only to face war once more. \n\nNow we must either fight for our freedom or our lives..."

But now, with the return of stability to the mainland, we have received a harsh ultimatum from the Indian government demanding we either submit or face the consequences. Now,we have to make a tough decision. \n\nIs it better to live one hour of a free life or a lifetime of servitude?"

twrindia.10.t:0 "Kashmir Submits"

twrindia.12.t:0 "The Asian Defense League Proposal"
twrindia.12.d:0 "We recently received a proposal from India from the Minister of Defense proposing for the possible formation of a new form of military alliance between China and India. The alliance, called the Asian Defense League will have a logistical and strategic character, ensuring that both China and India will come to the aid of the other if the need arises and either nation is attacked. \n\nWe have to be skeptical before we accept such an offer. If we do, we will have a strong ally on our side but we will be obliged to assist them in a war that might not be in our interests. If we decline, we lose a possible ally but gain a potential future subordinate. The final choice is behind our signature."
twrindia.12.a:0 "A United Front will be worth it!"

twrindia.13.d:0 "Having accepted and signed our proposal, Prime Minister Bose and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek met today at Delhi to officialy declare the creation of the Asian Defense League, guaranteeing the protection of eastern Asia from outside imperialists. The ADL as they call it, was seen by high officials of both nations as a great movement forward but comments from foreign leaders have been nervous, fearing a new world order in Asia being created by the two powerhouses."
twrindia.13.a:0 "Together we will stand against Imperialists!"
twrindia.14.t:0 "The Indian Unity League"
twrindia.14.d:0 "With China having rejected our proposal for the formation of a defense alliance, we have decided to establish our own sphere of influence through the Indian Unity League. If the Chinese dont wish to work with us, we will make sure that they are pushed away from us, starting with Burma!"
twrindia.14.a:0 "We will show them who's stronger!"
twrindia.15.t:0 "The Little Blue Book of Subhasism"
twrindia.15.d:0 "Prime Minister Subhas Chandra Bose has been working away for months behind the scenes. When not managing matters of government and state it appears the loved post-colonial leader has laboured to provide a firm ideological spine to his new government. A long advocate for patriotic, autarkic, anti-imperialist and pan-Indian ideals, Bose has today announced that he has taken the initiative to author a text which may soon rival the giants of the Communist Manifesto and Mein Kampf. \n\nThe 'Quotes and Teachings of Subhas Chandra Bose', known colloquially as the 'Little Blue Book' for its coloured cover, is a collection of the various speeches and ideas of Bose's which is hoped to unite the country by solidifying its national ideology. Already the printing presses work overtime to keep up with demand for the new book. Governmental supporters of Bose's government have begun peppering Bose's quotes into their appeals, and groups of dedicated and radical youths have picked up on the trend and seek to implement Bose's teachings into both their political and social lives. \n\nThough detractors see this as a blatant move into authoritarianism by the Prime Minister and seemingly fear the radicalisation this might encourage, especially amongst the Hindu population, it will if nothing else bolster Bose's already sizeable support base and ease his future political projects."

Citing the benefit that annexation could bring Hyderabad and the rest of India alike, the Indian government has promised no hostile action towards to the Nizam if the people should refuse to join the republic. With this in mind, the Prime Minister of Hyderabad has brought the referendum to the people. After much deliberation from both sides of the argument from all branches of government and the civilian populace, the last votes have been counted and the results are..."

twrindia.19.d:0 "This morning, our foreign office received a telegram from the Indian capital of New Delhi suggesting a democratic referendum on the integration of Mysore into the Republic of India. Understanding that we're in no real position to decline holding a referendum, the Maharaja has reluctantly agreed to let the referendum happen on the condition that the Indian government agrees to respect Mysore's sovereignty if they should vote to remain independent. After a short campaign from pro-Indian and pro-independence politicians, the votes are finally tallied and the results reveal that..."

twrindia.22.t:0 "A Cable To The Himalayas"
twrindia.22.d:0 "It is quite evident to Desai and the rest of the Indian government that our strategic and economic position is far too important in the intricate balance of power between India and China. There's just one small obstacle in their plans; We continue to rule over the small kingdom with absolute power, our desire to join the Indian Union is miniscule and we prefer to maintain Sikkim's isolationism. The time of isolationism in the global theatre, however, is over. Convinced that we will understand this blatant fact, Desai has personally cabled us with a simple proposal. Since Sikkim's desire for independence is understandable, it is increasingly impossible to maintain this position given the ever-turbulent state of Asian politics. Desai has promised us military protection, economic security and the preservation of the Namgyal dynasty in exchange for limited Indian jurisdiction over the kingdom. Pleading to the us to think of the security of our people in the near and distant future, Desai ended the telegram with a fiery monologue on how a peacefully-united India could stand up to foreign aggressors and the power democracy could have for the people who've been robbed of the right to choose for generations."

twrindia.25.t:0 "The Kashmir Referendum"
twrindia.25.d:0 "With the rise of the Desai government, referendums have been taking place all around India for wether the autonomous nations of the Indian subcontinent wish to rejoin into India. After Hyberabad and Mysore, its now our turn and the Indian government has already sent two proposing choices. The first is for the full integration of Kashmir into India as part of its territory. The second is for Kashmir to be established as an autonomous republic under the jurisdiction of India, with our current monarchy still in place. Of course, we also have the option to vote against both choice and go our merry way. Now, the fate of Kashmir lies in the hands of its citizens."

twrindia.29.d:0 "Narayan sat in the president's office, now his office, the morning sun seeping in through half open curtains. \n\nBut he saw neither, eyes closed he saw before him visions of a dream made manifest, a dream which had propelled him all the way from the flood-prone banks of Ghagara to the highest office in India. \n\nHis visions were that of another country, in another time. Following the vision of the now long gone man of steel. His country now reduced to a sliver, its last remnants torn apart by idealistic juveniles and frothing mad men. \n\nYet the glory remained. He saw collectivized agriculture, people working with each other not against, a strong india which would defend the revolution where the soviets had failed. The fires of revolution would burn bright, engulfing all of asia, its people finally united and free, and at last the accursed white sun torn from the sky lest its opium addled rays would poison all of Asia. \n\nYet his dreams of red were interrupted, as before him stood another man. His vision of India similar yet fundamentally different. \n\nHe envisioned India in black and white. The people governing from the ground up, not from above. Of an India that would truly fulfill the Mahatma's dream of a peaceful world. The people of asia would still be liberated, the accursed white sun still plucked from the sky, but it would not be by fire and sword. It would be by ideal alone.India would not burn like a raging fire that threatened to consume all but as a shining beacon of peace, progress and liberation in the world. \n\nThen the man was gone..."

twrindia.30.d:0 "At about 11 in the morning, shots were heard of the parliament in Rangoon, with similar reports coming out of many of the city's police precincts. Half an hour later, communist revolutionary Ne Win went on the radio to announce that the Burmese Socialist Programme Party has seized control of all major government buildings, armories, and police instruments in Rangoon. By noon, Win had declared the establishment of a people's republic over all of Burma, with similar reports of conflict coming out of other major cities in the country. \n\nThere had been murmurs of revolutionary socialist sentiment in the countryside before now, but this sudden seizure of power has many, both within Burma and abroad, by surprise. As a general in the Burmese army, Win had the means to mount an attack on the Burmese government, but the swiftness of the coup has provoked much suspicion. Immediately, there were accusations of the revolutionaries being backed by the new socialist government in India, which were exacerbated when reports of Indian officials appearing at Rangoon's largest port came about. With full control of the country, and the previous government being sent into exile in Thailand, the tide of Socialism has claimed yet another country in Asia. Only time can tell how matters will develop."

twrindia.32.d:0 "'Workers and peasants of Pakistan! Gather your arms! Kill the bourgeois parasites!' \n\nIs a chant that was heard all across Pakistan this morning. In cities large and small, in every factory floor and army barrack, in every degenerated farming community, the Pakistani masses have risen up against the country's wealthy elites. Led by the Pakistani Communist Party, and carrying arms that are suspected to be of Indian origin, the revolutionaries have managed to gain control of the country. Elements of the disposed government have fled abroad, while loyalist and reactionary militias have opened fire against the communists in certain parts of Pakistan. They are likely to be smashed, however, and the red star of socialism has laid claim to yet another country.  The new order will likely align itself towards India, and it is fueled by a determination to rid Pakistan of the vestiges of capitalism, reaction, and neo-colonialism. Only time will tell what is in store for the people of Pakistan."

At the ballots, the people of India are presented with three options.\n\nThe first is Subhas Chandra Bose, leader of the social democratic faction of the Indian National Congress. His line is one of self-reliance, as well as the political and cultural unification of the Indian subcontinent. The ultranationalist energy of his campaign has produced a highly loyal and dedicated base, eager to unite all of India under one culture and erase any vestige of British colonialism.\n\nHis main opposition on the left are the INC Socialists guided by Jayaprakash Narayan. Narayan seeks to recreate Indian life, both culturally and economically. However, the Socialists are a coalition split between the Marxist-Leninists and the Gandhian pacifists, and it is unsure which faction would gain supremacy if they were to win the election.\n\nDistinct from both of these factions are the liberal-conservatives under Moraji Desai. Desai is not a nationalist nor a socialist. The conservatives seek to spur the Indian economy through the use of free market policies, and western investments. Calling for peaceful expansion. His platform is not as radical as the other two, but stranger things have happened on this land.

twrindia.50.d:0 "The farmer, Sambhu, his handsome face a mask of sorrow. The landlord, a picture in abject apathy, his face half-shadowed. It's a scene ripped from the theatre, and from the headlines, with taut dialogue that could have been plucked from the streets of any provincial city in India. \n\n"For the farmer, the land itself is a mother - are you to force me to sell my own mother?" Sambhu cries. The landlord's response is cold: "It must be so, and I shall be your mother now." The music swells, the drama heightens, and Sambhu, the protagonist of Do Bigha Zamin, has his life fall a little further into disrepair. \n\nDo Bigha Zamin's transparently socialist themes and its use of Neo-Realist techniques from Italian cinema have not kept the film from critical success in local and international audiences. Stunning stylistic cinematography, engrossing character acting, and an unblinkingly intimate look at Indian rural and urban life have turned director Bimal Roy into a critical darling, and it is said the film is destined for awards at the Cannes International Film Festival. \n\nThe film's narrative, following the farmer Sambhu on his journey into despair as his land and family fall apart under the pressures of urban life and rural poverty, has met with equal acclaim, as a human story interweaving authentic village experiences with the complexity of modern development. As Indian socialists agitate for a kinder approach to what many see as rural exploitation, many anticipate that the rural approach will only become more popular over time. \n\nBimal himself has taken his success in stride, saying only that the Indian common-man must be the subject of Indian art. As producers attempt to reiterate his success in Bollywood, it seems that his vision is slowly realising itself."

twrindia.51.d:0 "Music has always been a part of New York City's history: the life of the city pulses to the beat of jazz-drums' vibrant rhythms by night and the gentle sounds of the classical composers by day. The insomniac city has an insatiable appetite for the new, the exotic, the unexpected motif at the end of the bar - and tonight someone has been invited from Delhi itself to whet their palates. \n\nAli Akbar Khan looks uncertain as he walks onstage at the Museum of Modern Art, to a smattering of applause: dressed only in robes of white, clutching something that looks like a lute but has far greater proportions. He bows twice to the audience, sits on a carpeted floor (he rejected the chair, citing artistic concerns) and nods for sitarist Ravi Shankar to come onstage. The two sit together, murmuring to each other in inaudible tones, and they begin to play. \n\nWhat follows is, in a word, magical. The sarod, for that is what Ali calls it, becomes a veritable orchestra in his capable hands - the lilting melodies of the strings waft and waver before the audience, suggesting at turns sorrow and grief, desperation and joy, blended into a single coherent melody. Lush and rich as the melody climaxes, sparse and coy when it retreats, the notes of Shankar's sitar trace the contours of human emotion with almost inhuman grace. \n\nAs the Jugalbandi tapers off and ends, the audience erupts into frenzied applause. Ali and Shankar bow again, thanking the Americans for their time, and withdraw - but their tunes will stay in the national imagination for a very long time."

twrindia.52.d:0 ""The pursuit of justice is blind to all relationships." The female lead of Mother India, Radha, utters these words as her son-turned-bandit dies in her arms - it is a tragedy to cap off a life of sorrows for the widow and mother, set against the backdrop of India's tumultuous struggle into independence. But what else is there to do, other than carrying on? \n\nMother India, possibly the most expensive and critically acclaimed Hindustani film of all time, has released in cinemas to instant star reviews, and many regard the remarkable work as an autobiography of India's own Decade of Decision. A nuanced portrayal of single motherhood in a patriarchal society, an examination of rural moneylending and a celebration of the strength of the Indian spirit - Mother India is all of these things, and far more than these, to local audiences. \n\nThe script of the film is as impressive as its visual flair: a complex blend of Urdu, literary and written Hindi, it is quite possibly the first film in Indian cinema to actively celebrate the young country's linguistic diversity in such a direct manner. As debates continue in the Delhi Parliament over the role of language in the country's textbooks, Mother India is proof to many that India's myriad tongues are not a weakness but its greatest strength. \n\nWhile the film itself is nearly universally celebrated, allegations regarding its controversial use of real flooding footage from Uttar Pradesh have soured reception for many socialist reviewers, with one biting critique calling it "an indulgence in the very luxury Mother India claims to avoid, cinematic excess." Even so, the film is expected to remain a high-water mark for future Indian films, and a good portent for Bollywood standards on the whole."
