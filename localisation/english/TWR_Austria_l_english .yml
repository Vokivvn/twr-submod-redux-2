AUS_The_Rebirth_of_the_Eagle_desc:0 "Almost two decades after we were swallowed whole by the Germans, the two headed eagle soars proudly once more. Yet even after escaping Prussian clutches again we have also been cast adrift in the world more. The new country will have to be build up again from the ground up.

AUS_Gott_Erhalte_Otto_den_Kaiser_desc:0 "\"Was eigentlich ein Skandal war, nämlich die Diskussion hier in Österreich über die Frage, ob Österreich ein Mitschuldiger war oder ob es ein Opfer war.

twraustria.1.t:0 "The Congress of Linz"
twraustria.1.d:0 "In an office chamber, ducked out between the ancient alleyways of an even ancient city, sat a group of people gathered in clandestinity. These were the people who remembered a time when their nation was not tethered to the monsters in Berlin, who fought under different flags, and who are willing to fight for them again. These were the elements of the Austrian resistance, discussing what was to be the state of their nation once it regained its independence. \n\nThe first to speak was the republican Julius Raab, member of the now defunct Christian Social Party. He denounced both the reactionary traditionalism of the old Habsburg monarchy and the traitorous nature of Austrofascism, calling for a return to republican democracy. There are many who feel spoken to by his message, but the monarchical and fascist factions can also find a common enemy in him. \n\nThe next to speak was Otto von Habsburg, the last crown-prince of the lands which used to be Austria-Hungary. He appealed to the greatest which the Habsburg crown had brought to Austria throughout her history, and how in the new chaotic state of Europe, Austria could reclaim her past greatness. For a nation which has been in chains for the past generation, this can be a powerful sentiment, but there are many who see the archduke as a useless fossil, incapable of leading a nation in the modern world. \n\nThe last to speak Ersnt Rüdiger Starhemberg, founder of the National Front and of Austrian's own experiment with fascism. While making sure to condemn the crimes of Nazism in Austria, Starhemberg spoke of the values of Austrian strength, and the need to root out elements which would seek to undermine Austria. There are many who are horrified at the idea of Fascism living on in Austria, but there are many others who believe that it is a tool which they can use to make their nation great again. \n\nHow will Austria be reborn?"
