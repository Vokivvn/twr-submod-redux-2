 ALEXEY_BAKSHEEV_DESC:0 "Alexey Baksheev is not the kind of person one would expect to run anything in his old age, let alone a disastrously unstable state such as Buryatia. Born in 1873, Baksheev was raised in a Trans-Baikal Cossack host where he quickly enrolled in military school. A seasoned veteran of the Russo-Japanese War, the Great War and the Russian Civil War, Baksheev fled with his cossack battalion to Manchuria when the Bolsheviks won the civil war. A political figure amongst cossack emigres in Manchuria, he cooperated with the imperial Japanese forces in the hopes of liberating his homeland from communism. When the Japanese Empire collapsed in the wake of American military campaigns, Baksheev fled to the newly-formed Russian Republic, being assigned as governor of Buryatia. Turning Buryatia into his personal fiefdom, Baksheev’s authority had all but disappeared as radical socialist paramilitaries fight the now-resurgent Russian Fascist Party in the streets. As his forces become stretched to their breaking point, the days remaining for Buryatia’s old marshal are much shorter than he might believe."

 BRY_Our_Annual_Report_to_Vladivostok: "Our Annual Report to Vladivostok"
 BRY_Our_Annual_Report_to_Vladivostok_desc:0 "As every year, the time has come to make a report to the government in Vladivostok meant to provide us with oversight. While in past years, these reports have been dull and uninteresting, with nothing of note to be reported, this year a number of problems have appeared that we’ll have to mention in our report. In the end, however, we can only really rely on ourselves to resolve these issues."
 BRY_Meeting_of_the_Central_Command:0 "Meeting of the Central Command"
 BRY_Meeting_of_the_Central_Command_desc:0 "Central Command has called for a meeting of its members, and none will refuse the summons, especially in a situation like this. To effectively resolve the looming crisis, swift but well considered decisions will need to be made."
 BRY_Finish_the_Anti_Fascist_Pacification_Campaign:0 "Finish the Anti-Fascist Pacification Campaign"
 BRY_Finish_the_Anti_Fascist_Pacification_Campaign_desc:0 "Though we started to root out the fascists infesting Buryatia when we began occupying the land, internal disagreements and organizational inefficiency ensured that this effort was not seen through to completion. That was a mistake, and finishing our anti-fascist purge takes top priority over any other problem. Only when we can be assured that fascism is good and dead here can we shift our focus to other enemies of freedom."
 BRY_End_the_Pogroms:0 "End the Pogroms"
 BRY_End_the_Pogroms_desc:0 "In some remote places, Russian fascists still carry out pogroms against isolated Jews, or those suspected of being Jewish. This must stop immediately, and we will do whatever it takes to ensure that it ends. Fascist bigotry cannot be tolerated if the people are to be free."
 BRY_Route_the_Baikal_Brothers:0 "Route the 'Baikal Brothers'"
 BRY_Route_the_Baikal_Brothers_desc:0 "The Russian fascists in Buryatia are led by a pair of terrorists known as the 'Baikal Brothers.' More clever than they look, and even uglier on the inside than on the outside, they are the top fascist threats to Buryatian freedom. We will rout their forces and force them to go on the run without delay. They will learn to feel fear before we deliver justice to them."
 BRY_Disperse_their_Marches:0 "Disperse their Marches"
 BRY_Disperse_their_Marches_desc:0 "The most foolhardy of the fascists have recently gotten it into their heads to protest our control by organizing marches in the streets against us. Unfortunately, not understanding the horrors of fascist belief, many ordinary people have begun to march alongside them. This cannot and will not stand, and action will be taken to end all such marches immediately. Our policing forces will make those who consider defying this order to reconsider."
 BRY_Shut_Down_their_Publishers:0 "Shut Down their Publishers"
 BRY_Shut_Down_their_Publishers_desc:0 "One of the biggest regrets of the failure to complete the first anti-fascist campaign is that some fascist publishers were allowed to survive in secret and continue writing and publishing their vile propaganda for the consumption of the easily misled masses. This is a mistake that will be corrected without delay. We will send police units to arrest those involved in fascist publishing and confiscate all machines and materials used to mass produce their lies."
 BRY_Operation_Netsvetov:0 "OPERATION: NETSVETOV"
 BRY_Operation_Netsvetov_desc:0 "The time has finally come to conclude the anti-fascist campaign. Their marchers rot in jail, their leaders are on the run, and their printing machines are broken. Just as they once made the defenseless live in fear, we have taught them what it means to be an enemy of the people. All that remains is to finish them off and arrest those of their leaders who remain active. This will finally break any remaining semblance of organization among them, and force any remaining followers of fascist ideology to return to an ordinary life where they can do no more harm."
 BRY_End_Marxism_in_its_Tracks:0 "End Marxism in its Tracks"
 BRY_End_Marxism_in_its_Tracks_desc:0 "The greatest threat to democratic freedoms, as always, is the Marxist menace. No matter how vile the fascists we both despise might be, the Marxists are the greater threat of the two and must be stopped before they have a chance to retake Buryatia and link up with the soviet threat to the west. Of course, this is easier said than done, especially with the organization by a certain Varlam Shalamov of the marxist group SRCO, whose numbers grow by the day."
 BRY_Burn_their_Pamphlets:0 "Burn their Pamphlets"
 BRY_Burn_their_Pamphlets_desc:0 "Convincing and inspiring as they might be, Marxist lies are still just that, lies and trickery. Unfortunately, most ordinary Russians can’t tell the difference between that and democratic reality, and so to protect them from being influenced towards the SRCO we will burn any and all of their pamphlets that we find."
 BRY_Disband_their_Unions:0 "Disband their Unions"
 BRY_Disband_their_Unions_desc:0 "One of the main tactics of Varlam and his SRCO is unionizing Buryatian workers, allowing them to paralyze our industry at a moment's notice, a key advantage in their campaign to take power. Though it will hurt in the short term, we must disband any and all known unions by force to protect our state, and therefore protect the people from communist tyranny."
 BRY_Siberian_Encirclement_Campaigns:0 "Siberian Encirclement Campaigns"
 BRY_Siberian_Encirclement_Campaigns_desc:0 "Small forces of marxist guerrillas, most of them ex-Red Army, can be found in the Buryatian wilderness. They pick off isolated soldiers from our forces, and increasingly even mount hit-and-run attacks on our outposts. We must put a stop to this menace before it is too late, by sending out our forces to locate, encircle, and annihilate all of these so-called 'partisans'. Without these brave but misled men and women, Varlam's days as a threat to us are numbered."
 BRY_Disband_the_Communes:0 "Disband their Communes"
 BRY_Disband_the_Communes_desc:0 "In rural Buryatia, some towns are run by the SRCO in all but name as 'communes', an anti-democratic organizational idea that seeks to erase human liberty. We will send out police units to find those organizing the townspeople into communes, arrest them, and dispel any notion that we are not in charge of even the most remote settlement."
 BRY_Operation_Vladimir:0 "OPERATION: VLADIMIR"
 BRY_Operation_Vladimir_desc:0 "Despite everything we have done to scatter his ambitions to the winds- reducing SRCO propaganda to ash, breaking their unions, and eliminating their partisans- Varlam Shalamov and other top SRCO leaders remain at large, and might still manage to rebuild and pose a renewed threat to us. This operation is entirely aimed at finding and arresting these evasive would-be tyrants, shooting them if necessary. We will find Varlam and bring him to justice, even if we have to look under every rock in Buryatia to do it."
 BRY_A_Hearts_and_Minds_Campaign:0 "A Hearts and Minds Campaign"
 BRY_A_Hearts_and_Minds_Campaign_desc:0 "Just as important as eliminating the enemies of democracy is ensuring that there are friends of democratic ideals among the people. We will make an effort to educate Buryatians about our good intentions and the benefits of well-run democracy, to convince them that our enemies are their enemies as well."
 BRY_Reinforce_Our_Garrisons:0 "Reinforce Our Garrisons"
 BRY_Reinforce_Our_Garrisons_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, garrisons in many parts of Buryatia are undermanned and undersupplied, and are at risk of being wiped out by a well-organized attack. To ensure that our bases at isolated but strategically important locations hold, we will reinforce these outposts with whatever men and munitions we have to spare."
 BRY_Repurpose_Old_Stockpiles:0 "Repurpose Old Stockpiles"
 BRY_Repurpose_Old_Stockpiles_desc:0 "Though they may seem outdated and even ineffective now, we have plenty of stockpiles of old, pre-war guns that are perfectly serviceable and could provide an excellent solution to our supply problem. People killed each other with these guns for years and years before being replaced; they’ll still do the same now, if we can figure out how to do necessary maintenance."
 BRY_An_Uneasy_Calm:0 "An Uneasy Calm..."
 BRY_An_Uneasy_Calm_desc:0 "Now that we have eliminated our top priority targets, we began to turn our attention to those we considered less important, only to be greeted by a sudden and almost total cessation of activity. While we’re happy to leave them be if they’ve chosen to stay quiet, we can't help but wonder whether this is a ruse, and something greater is coming."
 
 BRY_Baksheevs_Passing:0 "The Christmas Riots"
 BRY_Baksheevs_Passing_desc:0 "Riots have broken out in all significant towns and cities in Buryatia, and our police are only barely managing to hold their own. In some places, they haven't held at all, and the rioters have taken over, with some traitors among locally recruited forces defecting to them. It would seem that those that remain of our enemies organized this, in an effort to destroy us before we could destroy them. The situation is rapidly deteriorating, and it seems only a matter of time before it develops into true rebellion."
 BRY_Reinforcements_from_Vladivostok:0 "Reinforcements from Vladivostok"
 BRY_Reinforcements_from_Vladivostok_desc:0 "It seems our close ties with Vladivostok are proving to be of use after all; despite their own troubles, they have managed to send us reinforcements to use as we see fit, a move that is greatly appreciated. All that remains is to not let their expectations down."
 BRY_Raise_the_Reserves:0 "Raise the Reserves"
 BRY_Raise_the_Reserves_desc:0 "In order to stand a chance against these extremist traitors, we must call for our reserve units to join the front. They might be meant only for emergencies, but if this isn't an emergency, nothing is. If nothing else, our currently active units will certainly appreciate the arrival of reinforcements of any kind."
 BRY_Crack_Open_the_Armories:0 "Crack Open the Armories"
 BRY_Crack_Open_the_Armories_desc:0 "In the confusion of the initial riots, several of our armories were forgotten about and remain unopened, with powerful and current weapons still locked inside. Obviously, if we want to win and crush the rebel forces, we must reach them and rescue the guns before the extremists can steal them. With an influx of modern weaponry, the tide is sure to turn."
 BRY_Holding_the_Line:0 "Holding the Line"
 BRY_Holding_the_Line_desc:0 "With our preparations finished, it’s time to endure the worst of what the extremists have to throw at us. They are mounting their most fearsome attack yet, but if we dig in and ready our guns, we are at last confident that we can hold the line and teach all these enemies of democracy a lesson in pain."
 BRY_The_Hills_are_Our_Battlefield:0 "The Hills are Our Battlefield!"
 The_Hills_are_Our_Battlefield_desc:0 "Now that we’re truly ready for a fight, it's time to take the fight to them. The rebel bases are located in the hills of the Buryatian wilderness, difficult country that makes it difficult to launch an offensive. So be it. We will crush their strongholds through sheer force, and in doing so hamstring their capacity for battle."
 BRY_One_Final_Offensive:0 "One Final Offensive"
 BRY_One_Final_Offensive_desc:0 "Though much reduced, the extremists continue to fight us, and have gathered together in a last, great force that continues to pose a formidable threat. However, this also means that if we can crush them now, this entire conflict will be over and the bitter foes of democracy will be driven from Buryatia, at least for now and hopefully for good. Gather together, for victory is right before us!"
 BRY_A_Return_to_Order:0 "A Return to Order"
 BRY_A_Return_to_Order_desc:0 "At long last, we are restoring lasting peace and order to Buryatia, with all radical elements eliminated or removed. Only reunion with the government in Vladivostok remains to be accomplished, and after that, our difficult mission will finally be over. This day has been long in the making, and those of us who have lived to see it are very fortunate. The fallen defenders of democratic freedoms shall never be forgotten, so long as the torch of liberty shines over Russia."

 BRY_no_nobles:0 "Future of the Garrison"
 BRY_no_nobles_desc:0 "The fires of the Great Patriotic War have cooled and a great darkness now hangs over Russia, one that will not be lifted for many years to come. This is an era of silence and uncertainty. No where is that more true than in the remote Irkutsk-Buryatia region, where the 65th Infantry Regiment is locked in an indefinite and inconclusive struggle with nationalist partisans. With little in the way of local infrastructure and few orders coming in from Vladivostok, the garrison tasked with safeguarding the frontier has grown bored and restless. \n\nRepetition has bred contempt among the soldiers for the native populace and vice versa. With tensions rising and partisan attacks growing bolder with each passing day, has the time come to dissolve the garrison?"
 BRY_find_nobles:0 "Extending the Occupation"
 BRY_find_nobles_desc:0 "Although our soldiers long for home, the statelet of Buryatia is just too unstable for us to pull out. The peace we're struggling to maintain is as fragile and fleeting as the first winter snow. \n\nThe US occupation will have to continue for the time being, perhaps until Russia is a unified country again."
 BRY_tsarists:0 "Reinforcing the Garrisons"
 BRY_tsarists_desc:0 "The US garrisons are of vital importance for the defense of the Buryat territory, providing supply, shelter and scouts for both our own troops and native recruits. With a steady stream of arms coming in from the homeland via Vladivostok, these garrisons can finally become the formiddable fighting force they were initially envisioned as."
 BRY_cossacks:0 "Bringer of Stability"
 BRY_cossacks_desc:0 "With the Siberian War destabilizing the Russian Republic, the USFB has ironically become a safehaven within the American-alligned regions of Russia. We're determined to keep it that way. Buryatia will be a shining beacon of stability and perhaps even prosperity one day, bearing the torch of liberty in the darkness of this foreign land."
 BRY_crown_officers:0 "Training Our Officers"
 BRY_crown_officers_desc:0 "Soldiers are like their guns, if they are not maintained properly then their effectiveness in battle suffers for it. Even though the possibility of a large-scale war is only a distant glint on the horizon, we can't just rest on our laurels in the meantime. The tedium of life in rural Siberia will dull our senses if we let it. With some of our men having served for many years now, a new generation needs to step in to shoulder their burden."
 BRY_wheres_palace:0 "The Reconstruction Scheme"
 BRY_wheres_palace_desc:0 "Despite the best efforts of the Bolsheviks to modernize their country, Russia stil lags far behind most of the civilized world in its industrial and agricultural capacity. The meager progress made by the previous regime was demolished by the Great Patriotic War. Much of the industry has been destroyed, looted, left to rust, or is no longer operable due to the people with the required knowledge being dead or missing. It is time to change that."
 BRY_build_palace:0 "Empower Local Industries"
 BRY_build_palace_desc:0 "Industrial strength can not just be forced onto by the outside, we must cultivate an entrepreneurial and innovative spirit among the russian populace itself. Restrictions on local businesses and firms shall be lifted and the people given the opportunity to work for themselves once more."
 BRY_palace_guards:0 "American Supplies"
 BRY_palace_guards_desc:0 "Beyond the Pacific lies the greatest country on earth, both politically and economically. With a myriad of the finest goods and weapons on the planet. These goods have long elevated Buryatia despite our small numbers beyond the other warlords of Russia and they shall do so for many years to come."
 BRY_dont_find_nobles:0 "We Are Pulling Out!"
 BRY_dont_find_nobles_desc:0 "For too long have our boys banged their heads against the walls of their barracks to at least feel something apart from boredom. With things all quiet on the eastern front General Cronkhite has decided to pull the bulk of our forces out, replacing them with russian officials and soldiers. Whilst unpopular with Vladivostok it's not like they can do much about it."
 BRY_rulings_hard:0 "Increasing Russian Influence"
 BRY_rulings_hard_desc:0 "The first step in our orderly retreat is to empower more russian officials and officers, responsibilities will be shifted to natives of the Buryat and the Republic, making sure that no bureaucratic instability opens us up to attacks from the neighboring warlords."
 BRY_get_help:0 "Begin the Withdrawal"
 BRY_get_help_desc:0 "With the paperwork done, the second step is to start the withdrawal in earnest. While a raffle will decide the portion of the poor devils that need to man the leftover posts we won't abandon the majority of our men rejoice as they can go grab their girlfriends and surfboards and stop for a nice pitstop in Hawaii."
 BRY_book_people:0 "Building a Local Security Force"
 BRY_book_people_desc:0 "Peace as every man knows does not last forever and despite our boredom the Buryat still serves as an important stronghold against the warlords of Siberia. The final step of our withdrawal will be filling the gaps we left with loyal, local men that shall defend their motherland in earnest and without screaming in their pillows every night from homesickness."
 BRY_throw_party:0 "A Russo-American Agreement"
 BRY_throw_party_desc:0 "With the future of the garrison decided, it is time to re-approach the russians and put the change in course onto paper with ink. Buryatia stands strong and shall do so until the accursed Bolsheviks are butchered to the last man!"

 BRY_party_supplies:0 "The Irkutsk Incident"
 BRY_party_supplies_desc:0 "After years of uneasy peace with bursts of violence here and there, the Irkutsk Incident has provided the necessary spark to set years of kindling ablaze. As thousands protest the US administration and the garrison deserting many outposts and checkpoints for fear of their lives, the fate of the special administrative zone hangs in the balance..."
 BRY_party_food:0 "America's Grip"
 BRY_party_food_desc:0 "With the despicable VNS defeated and the people of Buryat made to understand the continued administration by US forces, we stand firm but in a difficult predicament. The status quo has become unacceptable and more importantly unsustainable. \n\nIf we hope to retain any US influence in the region we must act quickly and prudently, lest another troope of drunkard idiots almost torch the nation."
 BRY_party_food_animals:0 "Indoctrination by Food"
 BRY_party_food_animals_desc:0 "The central Russian famine has wracked the region for years, snuffing out thousands of lives and jeopardizing perhaps millions more - and thanks to Russia's agricultural predicament worse yet a thing not only of the present but the future. However chaos, it seems, is also a ladder and with the almost infinite supply of food we can request from the US, Buryat might soon turn into the beacon of hope for the russian peoples it was always meant to be."
 BRY_party_food_fruits_and_cheese:0 "Lessening Restrictions on G.I.s"
 BRY_party_food_fruits_and_cheese_desc:0 "In the rest of the world such appalling behavior as in the Irkutsk incident by our soldiers would being court martialed on the spot and their entire battalion punished. Siberia is not like the rest of the world. Ironically, the obscene behavior these soldiers displayed may be best reigned in by giving our soldiers a reason not to drink in excess, instead lifting some of the heaviest restrictions will hopefully give our men the morale boost they need to not loose their grip in the russian wastes."
 BRY_party_food_storage:0 "Operation Siberian Freedom"
 BRY_party_food_storage_desc:0 "With the USFB stabilized and our men forged into the liberators Siberia deserves, it is time to decide rather the operation is completed or not."
 BRY_party_drink:0 "Returning to Russia"
 BRY_party_drink_desc:0 "With the GIs misdeeds having forever lost the trust of the Buryat people, General Cronkhite saw prudent to at last truly bring our boys home. The United States Forces in Buryat will relinquish all control of the area to the jurisdiction in Vladivostok in the hopes that the Russians will be able to appease their own kin in ways foreigners never could hope to."
 BRY_party_drink_french_champagne:0 "Employment Opportunities for Locals"
 BRY_party_drink_french_champagne_desc:0 "The american garrison whilst small compared to the number of locals still has ample need for outside assistance. Be it manning the american runways, arms factories or supplies lines there are ample employment opportunities for the locals. Besides the obvious logistic advantage this may also these strangers from a strange land that we without a doubt are in the minds of the locals more tangible and perhaps even amicable to them."
 BRY_party_drink_finnish_champagne:0 "Tyrants into Lake Baikal"
 BRY_party_drink_finnish_champagne_desc:0 "Lake Baikal is not only considered the worlds deepest lake at approximately 745m, but also the oldest at approximately 25 million years. Those foreign soldiers who weren't able to escape back to Vladivostok will soon wish they had't been taken alive. Every tyrant who assisted in the oppression of the Russian people will be bound with concrete and cast into the depths of that primordial abyss. All those who stand in opposition to a free and united Siberia will be punished thusly."
 BRY_party_entertainment:0 "An Enigma Rises..."
 BRY_party_entertainment_desc:0 "In the heart of Russia an enigma rises. Freed from the shackles of bolshevism and capitalism. Standing alone in a sea of the old, a new order rises. Never again shall the russians be shackled, never again shall the russians be ruled by tyrants, never again will the\n\nRussians have to suffer the outsider."
 BRY_party_entertainment_american:0 "American Weapon Caches"
 BRY_party_entertainment_american_desc:0 "The yanks leaving in a hurry have left quite the selection of goods in our lands. While the irony of using the cock of the rifle that beat us for so long ourselves is lost on none their ability to strike down the enemies of the people is unmatched in the russian wastes. Such a technological edge shall be most useful once we burn the tyrants of Russia to ashes!"
 BRY_party_entertainment_italian:0 "Establish Ethnic Communes"
 BRY_party_entertainment_italian_desc:0 "For millennia the people of the world toiled happily in their fields, mines and homes. Amongst their own kin, free from the poison of commerce they found true happiness. Yet with the arrival of the modern age, the foreign hordes and the almighty dollar the people became collared, shackled to false idols and ideas that went against their very livelihood. \n\nNow the people have stood up and stand once more free and proud, alone."
 BRY_party_entertainment_monitoring:0 "For a Stateless Fatherland!"
 BRY_party_entertainment_monitoring_desc:0 "The idea of a truly free man has only surfaced for a brief glimpse in modern times, in the streets of Paris, in the dust of the Spanish civil war and finally in distant Ukraine. Their efforts quickly crushed by Bourgeois and Bolshevik hand. We shall never let this come to pass again, we shall rage against the enemies on all sites till no state, no tyrant only the spirit of the fatherland remains."
 BRY_party_guest_list:0 "Our Might is Unstoppable!"
 BRY_party_guest_list_desc:0 "We are the liberators of Russia! The warlords fear us, the Bolsheviks dread the day we stand at their doorstep and the Republic grows uneasy at the sight of the might of our horde! \n\nWe shall rampage through the russian wastes and in every liberated town and hamlet we shall raise our banners for the world to see, Here be freedom!"

 BRY_party_guest_list_neighbors_desc:0 "In the midst of Russia, a new order rises a union not of soviets, republics or whatever honey the tyrants coat their leashes in. A confederation of equal ethnic communes where every russian man, woman and child may live their life to the fullest. With the liberated Buryat as our stronghold we shall unshackle the other warlords till the Republic and Union have in their midst a formidable enemy that shall end them all the same."
 BRY_party_guest_list_strangers:0 "An American Bulwark Against Bolshevism"
 BRY_party_guest_list_strangers_desc:0 "In the midst of Russia a trench rises, manned by the patriots of Russia and America, wielding the finest weapons of both. All united in a singular purpose: stamping out the Red Menace forever. We shall be the first line of defense, the first bulwark, against the red tide. The Reds will break their men on our walls again and again till they are weak and exhausted and then the true Republic shall venture forth and end them at last."
 BRY_party_final_prep:0 "Cementing Our Legacy!"
 BRY_party_final_prep_desc:0 "With our enemies both within and without crushed by the might of military, a moment of respite has come. We stand alone in the siberian wastes, to our left the Soviets to our right the Republic. With both eyeing us anxiously it is time to go out with a bang and leave one last mark on the region!"
 BRY_wrap_it_up:0 "Wrap it Up!"
 BRY_wrap_it_up_desc:0 "With Operation Siberian Freedom over for better or worse, it is time to again look inwards and leave our mark on the region so that the eventual transfer of power to the Republic goes smoothly and the statelet is well guarded against the horrors beyond the border."
 BRY_building_an_independent_buryatia:0 "Building a Nation"
 BRY_building_an_independent_buryatia_desc:0 "Before Russia is reunited once more and the Bolshevik forever vanquished perhaps decades more will pass, the future remains uncertain. In the meantime we must build up the Buryat Republic as its own largely autonomous bulwark against the pretenders to the russian throne. Only that way can the security and stability of the region be guaranteed."
 BRY_authority_to_russia:0 "Russian Authority"
 BRY_authority_to_russia_desc:0 "The Irkutsk Incident has shown that the russians won't let themselves by ruled by none but their own. We must begin to prematurely build up the structures that are supposed to govern Buryat for preferably decades to come, as a federal subject of the Russian Republic."

 twrnewburyatia.1.t:0 "The Status of Buryatia"
 twrnewburyatia.1.d:0 "The situation in the Buryatia Military Okrug is nothing short of bleak. While officially a state in the Russian Republic, Buryatia's sweeping hills and forests have been the source of heavy partisan activity ever since Japanese and Soviet authority collapsed in the far east. On the far-right, the once fledgling Russian Fascist Party has seen a surge in popularity among a population that frequently finds itself without food and shelter. On the far-left, the revived Socialist Revolutionary Combat Organisation has caused our overstretched administration even more stress as they fight both RFP blackshirts and government forces in the streets of Ulan-Ude. On top of all it, the aging Baksheev has shown little interest in his state's deterioration, preferring to live out his tenure as governor cooped up inside his home. With anarchy spreading rapidly and the fate of the Republic in limbo, only a miracle can hope to save Buryatia and Free Russia."
 twrnewburyatia.1.a:0 "We will endure."
 
 twrnewburyatia.2.t:0 "The Meeting of the General Command"
 twrnewburyatia.2.d:0 "With law and order rapidly breaking down with every passing day, the Buryat general command has decided to finally take action against the terrorists plaguing Buryatia. With our forces already stretched dangerously thin, there will only be enough state resources to snuff out one of the dissident groups rampant in Buryatia."
 twrnewburyatia.2.a:0 "The fascists are a greater threat."
 twrnewburyatia.2.b:0 "The prefidious Marxists must be stopped!"
 
 twrnewburyatia.3.t:0 "End the Russian Fascists"
 twrnewburyatia.3.d:0 "It was their poisonous ideology that brought half of our great Russia under the Nazi jackboot, and yet the Hiterlite supporters still stand strong admist the face of indisputable facts and logic. While we cannot dissuade them from abandoning such horrible beliefs, we have no choice but to put Rodzayevsky's rabid dogs down right here and now."
 twrnewburyatia.3.a:0 "Fascism is anything but Russian!"
 
 twrnewburyatia.4.t:0 "Ending Russian Marxism"
 twrnewburyatia.4.d:0 "It is perhaps the ugliest stain on Russian history. The legacy of Marxist Bolshevism has lead a once proud Russia into the dirt thanks to tyrants like Lenin and Stalin. Just as Soviet authority collapsed before our arrival, new groups have attempted to take up the mantle of Karl Marx's toxic teachings. It is now up to us to finally put the socialst disease to rest."
 twrnewburyatia.4.a:0 "The only good Marxist is a dead one."
 
 twrnewburyatia.5.t:0 "OPERATION: NETSVETOV"
 twrnewburyatia.5.d:0 "Breaking into the RFP headquarters in the middle of the night, our security forces found the presumed-dead Konstantin Rodzayevsky hunched over a chair seemingly willing to accept his fate. After a brief firefight between Rodzayevsky's closest bodyguards and our forces, the entire Russian Fascist Party leadership now lay dead. Fascist bile in free Russia has finally been extinguished."
 twrnewburyatia.5.a:0 "So ends the so-called "Vozhd"."
 
 twrnewburyatia.6.t:0 "OPERATION: VLADIMIR"
 twrnewburyatia.6.d:0 "The socialist base of operations has been for the most part based in the sprawling countryside of Buryatia. Eliminating this natural barrier, our troops took to burning the forests with the highest levels of partisan activity. As the flames blotted out the sky, our troops had easy pickings taking out the sociialist partisans until no more bodies emerged from the forest's smouldering remains."

 twrnewburyatia.7.t:0 "Riots on Christmas Day!"
 twrnewburyatia.7.d:0 "On what was meant to be a holiday like any other, massive riots broke out across Buryatia as dissatisfied protestors, terrorists and state security forces clashed in city streets and villages squares. Leaving much of the state now in disarray, the riots have caused considerable damage to what little state infrastructure remains as the threat of full-on revolt has now become a stark reality."

 twrburyatia.1.t:0 "Future of the USFB!"
 ###Someone change those 
 twrburyatia.1.d:0 "Following the American intervention in the Russian Far East and the creation of the American-aligned Russian Republic, most forces had been withdraw to enjoy the end of the Pacific War at home. Most, but not all. A small number of specialist forces were sent to bolster the White Russian forces in the lake Baikal region, forming the US Forces in Buryatia expeditionary force. Fighting various regional warlords, the force has now been on deployment for over five years and now sees little fighting. Of course, the effects on the force's morale of being stationed in the wasteland of Siberia to do nothing is immense, but they had been kept there on the insistance of Vladivostok. Now, though, things have come to a head, with a big push both in the United States and among the men in Buryatia to bring the last of the soldiers home."
 twrburyatia.1.a:0 "They can't come home yet"
 twrburyatia.1.b:0 "Their mission is over"
 #twrburyatia.2.t:0 "Food for the Party"
 #twrburyatia.2.d:0 "Every proper party by royalty has a vast banquet of food from all over the world. Our party must have the same status! But the...conditions of our location don't allow us for many options. So we have two options! \n\nOur first option to go for fish, a good treat and hell, maybe we may find some caviar along the way. Our other option is to delve into the marvelous world of cheese! So many kinds and choices will show our guests that we are sophisticated like the monarchs in France! \n\nTheres still monarchs in France, right?"
 #twrburyatia.2.a:0 "Fish is on the Menu!"
 #twrburyatia.2.b:0 "Cheese is on the Menu!"
 twrburyatia.3.t:0 "Operation Siberian Freedom"
 twrburyatia.3.d:0 "With the USFB stabilized and our men forged into the liberators Siberia deserves, it is time to once more look outwards. Beyond the borders of the Buryat and the Republic lie the warlords of the wastes and beyond that the accursed red star. \n\nWhile a group seeks to wrap up the current operations, some think that the US' task in Siberia has yet to be completed.\n\nIs Operation Siberian Freedom completed? Is it really time for the Americans to go home? These are the questions flowing inside the heads of the local command, which have been given almost full authority to decide for this little occupational government."
 twrburyatia.3.a:0 "It's time to go home."
 twrburyatia.3.b:0 "We ought to liberate more!"
 #twrburyatia.4.t:0 "Drinks for the Party"
 #twrburyatia.4.d:0 "From ancient times, parties were places where guests drunk alchoholic beverages. This party will be the same! As in accordance with our great duchy, we must have the drink of Kings, champagne! But the problem lies wether we want actual Champagne from the region of Champagne in France, or just Sparkling Wine from Finland."
 #twrburyatia.4.a:0 "Only the best for my guests!"
 #twrburyatia.4.b:0 "Finnish Champagne arrives quicker."
 twrburyatia.5.t:0 "Entertainment for the Party"
 twrburyatia.5.d:0 "In every successful party, theres always some sort of entertainment in order keep the guests busy and occupied. If not, then it will be one very boring party. Afterall, you can chatter so much before you run out of saliva. Thus, we must look towards the outside for entertainment. In the East we got the Yanks and their fancy musicians and all that. In the West, we have the Italians and their...circuses? \n\nDoes anyone know what Italy is famous for?"
 twrburyatia.5.a:0 "Some American Musicians won't hurt."
 twrburyatia.5.b:0 "I guess the Italians will have something to offer."
 twrburyatia.6.t:0 "Subversives Among Us"
 twrburyatia.6.d:0 "As we prepare to the entertainment for our party, we have been informed that there are individuals among us that wish to disrupt our party. We are not sure exactly who those may be but many suspect the men in red from the South. We ought to take over and make sure they don't ruin our plans for the great party."
 twrburyatia.6.a:0 "The quicker we intervene, the less chances they will ruin the party!"
 twrburyatia.6.b:0 "We can take care of them later."
 twrburyatia.7.t:0 "Who should we invite?"
 twrburyatia.7.d:0 "We have finally prepared everything we need so we can host our party. But we need one last thing, guests! Now, we have to options really on who to invite. One is for kind neighbours in the East, the White Russians, we have met before and talked to so they will probably like us. The other option is to invite guests from the Western nations, like the USA, the UK and many others. \n\nBut the point still stands, the more guests, the better!"
 twrburyatia.7.a:0 "Lets invite our neighbours!"
 twrburyatia.7.b:0 "We should make some new friends!"
 twrburyatia.8.t:0 "Our Last Step to Greatness"
 twrburyatia.8.d:0 "The sounds of boots marching and trumpets blowing can be heard from all over the tundra- Buryatia stands triumphant, at last as a true force of might, finally victorious over its petty rivals ! Through cunning planning, fierce determination and the courage of the Buryatian people, we have conquered the entirety of Central Siberia, integrating it into our proud nation. No one can deny, even our enemies, that we are a true force to be wrecking with and what remains of those who stand against us should fear us! \n\nNow however, we are met with our grandest challenge so far. We arent the greatest russian state. In fact, we are the only one. To establish the final stone of our legacy, our last step on the path to greatness, we must choose who we should take out once and for all. \n\nWe can march west, to Omsk and Perm, and storm the remainders of The Red Army, annihilate the NKVD and finally end the worker's delusion of relevance and power! We can also march east, to Vladivostok, and conquer the weak Russian Republic, taking their lands for ourselves and establishing an eternal legacy over Siberia!"
 twrburyatia.8.a:0 "Down with the Russian Republicans!"
 twrburyatia.8.b:0 "Down with the Bolsheviks!"
 twrburyatia.9.t:0 "A Buryatian Republic"
 twrburyatia.9.d:0 "As American forces withdraw, the de facto rulers of the Buryatia territory disappears, leaving behing a mostly desolate, but not uninhabited, land. With responsibility to rule themselves being passed back to the inhabitants of the region, a new state, a Buryatian Republic, rises."
 twrburyatia.9.a:0 "A new state!"
 twrburyatia.10.t:0 "The Irkutsk Incident"
 twrburyatia.10.d:0 "As the sun dawned on the Great Baikal and rose over the tundra, Buryatia was woken up by turmoil. Huge masses of people by the thousands marched on the streets, waving flags and signs, shouting for change, for a new future. Their demands are for the American marines to finally leave their home, so a true and legitimate government can take their place. There has always been heavy disapproval of our rule over Buryatia, but never on such a scale, never so fierce. \n\nThe protests were the biggest and most violent in Irkutsk, the city on the Baikal, and our capital, where protesters  threw rocks and tried to overwhelm our forces. In one case, later nicknamed the \"Irkutsk Incident\", a few soldiers were brought down by several angry protesters, leading to the other marines dispersing the crowd with warning shots and physical violence. Several people, including 7 protesters and 1 marine have been rushed to the hospital, all currently in serious condition. After the incident protests have only grown, leading to shops and buildings have been looted and the situation growing evermore tireless. \n\nWe fear that if we don't take action soon, we might not even have the chance to do so later on. We must make an important choice now. We can stay and solidify our rule on Buryatia with harsh crackdowns on protests and enforcing of our authority in the cities. We can, however, decide to leave, but make sure the region transitions to the Russian Republic and a safe order of democracy is established, or alternatively, just leave the region to its own devices."
 twrburyatia.10.a:0 "We are in charge here, not some angry mobs!"
 twrburyatia.10.b:0 "Let's make sure The Russian Republic safely annexes the region!"
 twrburyatia.10.c:0 "Pack up boys, we're going home!"
 twrburyatia.11.t:0 "The Future of Buryatia"
 twrburyatia.11.d:0 "In the land of forests and snow, of endless tundra and vigorous people, Buryatia stands strong. We have finally crushed our last big obstacle in the region- This being the nation of Norilsk. The Marines have finally completed their goal of bringing law and order back to a part of Siberia, subjugating the Norilsk warlord and bringing him to their will, achieving to bring some sense to stability to Siberia. \n\nBut as the soldiers cheer and the high command celebrates, the situation is somber. The people are not happy, they look with indifference, in tirenese...and we begin to realise, that we have overstayed our visit. Buryatia wants freedom. And so, Buryatia shall get it! We, however, have only one problem left to resolve. \n\nWho is to control these lands? \n\nOne option is to get in contact with the Russian Republic in Vladivostok and negotiate the unification between it and Buryatia, which will surely strengthen the Rus and give them a good fighting chance against the Bolsheviks. \n\nOr, on the other hand, we can begin the preparations for a Buryatian Social Democratic Republic, overseeing the peaceful transition and then leave this beautiful land to its own devices, happy at last."
 twrburyatia.11.a:0 "Contact the Russian President, we will not keep the russian people disunited."
 twrburyatia.11.b:0 "Long live the Buryatian Republic!"

 BRY_Aftermath_Anti_Fascist_Pacification_Campaign:0 "Aftermath of the Anti-Fascist Pacification Campaign"
 BRY_Aftermath_Anti_Fascist_Pacification_Campaign_desc:0 "In the late 1940s, the Russian Republic launched an expedition into Siberia with the objective of securing the region before local warlords - or worse, the Soviet Union - did it first. However, they only got as far as Buryatia before their advance came to a grinding halt with the discovery of the RFP. What followed was a long, bloody conflict that tore the region apart. Although the RFP was eventually defeated in a joint Russo-American military intervention and many of the organisation's leaders, including Konstantin Rodzayevsky, were killed, the scars of the conflict are still clear on every building in Ulan-Ude, as well as in the destroyed villages of the countryside. Recently, however, there have been rumours going about that the Russian Fascist Party may still live on. Could it be true, or is it just more gossip?"

 BRY_Dissident_Terrorism_desc:0 "During the Anti-Fascist Pacification Campaign, many socialists who resided in the Russian Republic rose to fight the RFP, forming a volunteer organisation and fighting there independently of Russo-American forces. In the times since, however, the Russian government has prohibited them from returning the nation proper, and they have formed their own organisation - the Socialist-Revolutionary Combat Organisation, named after the terrorist organisation during the days of the Russian Empire. In the time since their exile, the SRCO has expanded its 'war' to include not only the RFP, but also the Russian Republic. \n\nMeanwhile, the RFP has gone underground, waging a war of terror against the Republic and its citizens after their military defeat years ago. While they may be only half as popular as the SRCO, their vast terror network stretching from Ulan-Ude to Vladivostok makes them twice as dangerous."
