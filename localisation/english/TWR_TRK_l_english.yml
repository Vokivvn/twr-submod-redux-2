  TRK_Three_Tyrants_One_Nation:0 "Three Tyrants, One Nation"
  TRK_Three_Tyrants_One_Nation_desc:0 "As a nation, the State of Turkestan is held together with the powers of cruelty and sheer force, under the uneasy tyrant alliance between the Pan-Turkic Unitary Party, the Islamic Revolution Movement and the Pan-Russian League of National Bolsheviks. Using violence and direct military action, the three suppress all unrest and potential enemies of the warlord state but are as willing to stab each other in the back at the same time."
  TRK_Iron_Industrial_Grip:0 "Iron Industrial Grip"
  TRK_Iron_Industrial_Grip_desc:0 "Holding the industrial and urban centers of the region, the Turkestani state holds an advantage over all of its neighbours, the ability to produce more than all of them combined. With arms at the ready and a bigger population, the Turkestani government is ready to use all their means to fight off their opposers."
  TRK_The_Illegal_Haven:0 "The Illegal Haven"
  TRK_The_Illegal_Haven_desc:0 "Being the crossroads state between China and Afghanistan, the location of the Turkestan Region is but perfect for the business of smuggling, drug trafficking, prostitution and so much more. With it being the "laundry room" of the KMT and the "no questions asked" market of all things illegal, the state may be rife with crime and corruption but it brings a hefty income to the state."

  TRK_Memories_Of_The_Great_Struggle_desc:0 "After the near-collapse of the USSR, the Turkestan region was briefly independent for the first time in decades.  However, ineffective and corrupt governance, along with multiple insurrection movements caused the state to fracture and collapse into further warlords.  All of these states are still defined by this collapse, and must seek to establish their own identity, and rebuild themselves."

  ###Leader###
  TAIMBET_DESC:0 "Taimbet Komekbaev was born in 1896 in the Kyzylorda region, Zhosaly village, and came from a local rural family. Life later led him to work in a coal warehouse until the Great Patriotic War began in 1941 when the Red Army drafted him to fight for them where he served briefly on the Leningrad front with the 128 Rifle Division where he carried out reconnaissance missions until the Wehrmacht he failed to break the Soviet front. Retreating with his troops to the depths of the Soviet Union and realizing that the war was lost, he decided to return to his home region where he began a series of rebellions against Soviet rule. Participating in Turkestan's independence, but the unstable state and internal unrest forced it to cooperate with extremely unconventional allies - Islamists in the East and Russian Suprematists in Kyrgyzstan. Taimbet is now set as the helm of this ship that seems to be sinking, but whether it will have the ability and strength to pull Turkestan out of this sinking despair remains to be seen."
  Torobai_Kulatov_DESC:0 "An experienced bureaucrat, Torobai Kulatov worked for almost his entire life. Kulatov was a member of the Communist Party and graduated from party school, he then went on to hold various positions for the Soviet Union, while also holding high positions in overseeing mining operations in the Kyrgyz regionm and from 1938 onwards, he was a member of the Central Committee and Bureau of the Communist Party of Kyrgyzstan.\n\nHe kept working in Kyrgyzstan during the war, but as anti-Soviet sentiments grew, Kulatov planned for his future. Using his decades of experience and knowledge gained in the party school, Kulatov assisted the formation of an independent Turkestan. In exchange, he formed his own political movement and dominated Kyrgyz politics, an effort that has paid off following the formation of an independent Kyrgyzstan."
  Bauyrzhan_Momyshuly_DESC:0 "Born in 1910, Bauyrzhan Momyshuly is a model Soviet soldier, having joined the army at a relatively young age. He was already a commander before the German-Soviet War started. During the war, his unit went on to fight in Leningrad and participated in the Battle of Moscow, although both battles were lost, his exceptional leadership skills were recognised by his superiors.\n\nBut as the war subsided, his unit was part of the reinforcement sent to quell the Turkestan independence movement. However, the Turkestanis eventually came out on top and forced Momyshuly to wage a guerrilla war against the nationalists. And after years of resistance work, Momyshuly finally has to chance to serve the motherland once more."

  TRK_Turkmenistan_Uzbekistan_Phase_I:0 "The Great Western Turkestani War"
  TRK_Turkmenistan_Uzbekistan_Phase_I_desc:0 "Our §GArmy Professionalism§!: [ROOT.GetTRK_Military_Professionalism] \n\nOur §CRelations with Our Sponsor§!: [ROOT.GetTRK_Sponsor_Relations] \n\nThere is a great storm ahead of us, and people have neither the weapons nor the expertise to fight the enemies on the border who are watching us suspiciously, waiting for the right moment to destroy us. We must not allow their expertise and skills to be in front of us, nor must the number of their weapons exceed our quantity. We considered this plan for a very long time and came to the conclusion that within one year we must do everything in our power to achieve this goal. A few points will be dedicated to the procurement of weapons, which we will be able to procure only if we have good relations with nations that are ready to help us in our noble goal of expelling and exterminating the infection that threatens to destroy everything we love and appreciate in our region. \n\nThe plan is quite simple - to bring the army and the people to the level we need, we will divide this plan into four phases. The first phase will be based on the quantity that will help us on further paths so that the number of soldiers will overcome all the problems we would have to hurry to achieve a quality army with a smaller number of soldiers. The second phase will have as standard the training of already conscripted soldiers and their adjustment to our goals towards professionalization. The third phase will have further training as well as the search for people who simply have no place in the army, while the fourth phase will complete all this by choosing the best of the best and discarding the worst of the best to create a large and quality army. \n\nFurthermore, our diplomatic centers will have to be located in the cities of countries that are willing to help us, but in order to achieve that, we will have to turn to some more drastic methods and provide the services they will ask us to do, but it will in the end it pays off because we have been promised help in the form of quantitative weapons, strategy theorists as well as volunteer expeditions that will help us in our fight for a region free from evil."

  ##Events OLD
  twrtrk.1.t:0 "Turkestani Civil War!"
  twrtrk.1.d:0 "Our power over the nation is leaking through our hands like sand! Our efforts to put down the different people of Turkestan have failed completely, with even our own people rebelling against us! \n\n We can do only one thing now, fight back!"
  twrtrk.1.a:0 "We must hold the nation together!"
  twrtrk.2.t:0 "Death of Eshon Babakhan"
  twrtrk.2.d:0 "With great sorrow in their hearts, the people of Turkestan grief the loss of their leader Eshon Babakhan ibn Abdulmajidkhan. One of the oldest leaders the world has seen, he left his last breath at the age of 95, leaving the people of Turkestan under the rule of his son, Zyiautdin Khan ibn Eshon Babakhan, an incompetent trader. With no intent to rule, he enjoys the lavish lifestyle of being the ruler of a nation while it begins to crumble around him."
  twrtrk.2.a:0 "That fat brat will get what's coming for him!"
  twrtrk.3.t:0 "End of the Civil War"
  twrtrk.3.d:0 "With both the Republicans and Loyalists in Turkestan defeated, the local nationalists have managed to strike a victory for themselves.\n\nTurkestan is no more, the state once known as Turkestan is now divided into multiple independent nations. However, Central Asia is far from being stable. But for now, let's allow the dust to settle."
  twrtrk.3.a:0 "Ah, the smell of freedom."
  twrtrk.4.t:0 "Turkestani Civil War"
  twrtrk.4.d:0 "With the rise of an incompetent ruler, the already unstable nation of Turkestan has found herself collapsing into a brutal civil war. Local nationalists representing the many ethnic groups in the region have armed themselves in an attempt to secure their freedom from the grip of Turkestani Government.\nWhile this war is mainly between the nationalists and the Loyalists, a faction of democrats in the Turkestan government managed to secure enough land to become a comparable faction in the civil war.\n\nPassing the point of no return, these disagreements in Turkestan must be settled by force, and this civil war will only end with the total collapse of Turkestan, or the defeat of nationalists."
  twrtrk.4.a:0 "How chaotic..."
  twrtrk.41.t:0 "Turkestan Dissolved"
  twrtrk.41.d:0 "After a brief experiment of Turkic unity during the Soviet collapse, the state of Turkestan is no more.\n\nWith the last shots fired and the dust settled, former Turkestan has been divided between the local resistance groups, with nations such as Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan openly calling for closer cooperation with the Soviet Union, some even suggest that these newly created states should join the Soviet Union as a way to rebuilt law and order in the Central Steppe.\n\nRight after a brutal civil conflict, tensions are building once again. Perhaps peace and stability were never meant for this cruel region?"
  twrtrk.41.a:0 "So long, Turkestan."
  twrtrk.42.t:0 "Central Asian People's Republic"
  twrtrk.42.d:0 "While technically not part of the Soviet Union, this newly proclaimed state is heavily influenced and supported by the Soviets. Named the Central Asian People's Republic (CAPR), this republic was declared by a so-called "Central Asian Politburo", with the help of Soviet advisors. This new nation's goal is to unite the Tajiks, Uzbeks, and the Kyrgyz into one socialist republic.\n\nWhile this might appear to be a repeat of the Turkestan experiment, the CAPR has gained a massive advantage by having the Soviet Union as their prime partner. And with a relatively modern army, comparing to the ones in Central Asia, the CAPR can use these resources to unify this region quicker than ever before."
  twrtrk.42.a:0 "Central Asia turns RED!"
  twrtrk.5.t:0 "Membership Offer"
  twrtrk.5.d:0 "Being the former leaders of our land, the Soviet Union has sent us a telegram, congratulating us about the liberation of our homeland. However, this telegram of congratulation came with a message, the Soviet Union's formal invitation to join the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic as a Soviet Socialist Republic.\n\nThey promised great autonomy and unchanged leadership for the member republics, alongside the long awaited law and stability into our regions.\n\nShould we join the Union or remain as an independent Republic?"
  twrtrk.5.a:0 "We accept the offer!"
  twrtrk.5.b:0 "I value my freedom above stability..."
  twrtrk.6.t:0 "Fate of Central Asia"
  twrtrk.6.d:0 "With Turkestan out of the picture, a number of Socialist Republics were established in the Turkestani Civil War. This is the golden opportunity for us to restore order within the Central Asian regions, with the Turkmens and Kazakhs expected to be loyal supporters of the Union.\n\nHowever, due to the resources needed for our upcoming reclamation, we have a plan to establish a friendly sister republic in Central Asia, making the task of enforcing control an easier task for the Soviet Union."
  twrtrk.6.a:0 "Central Asia awaits!"
  twrtrk.6.b:0 "Let's leave those plans alone."
  twrtrk.7.t:0 "Tajik Autonomy"
  twrtrk.7.d:0 "Under the threat of imminent Soviet invasion, the Turkestani occupation of Tajikistan has scaled back dramatically, with Turkestani garrisons being relocated to the front, while Tajik elements are given more control on their internal affairs. This new arrangement has effectively lifted the most burdensome factors enforced onto the Tajiks since their defeat."
  twrtrk.7.a:0 "A necessary measure."
  twrtrk.7.b:0 "One step closer to freedom!"
  twrtrk.8.t:0 "Kyrgyz Secession"
  twrtrk.8.d:0 "With our military crippled by our recent defeat, our garrison in Kyrgyzstan went over to the side of the local nationalists. Our supposedly loyal governor, Torobai Kulatov signed the "Declaration of Kyrgyz Independence", appointing himself as the first president of Kyrgyzstan with the support of his very own army.\n\nWhile our military could easily defeat this little republic, our soldiers are currently preoccupied with putting down riots across the country, attempting to quell a much larger crisis on the horizon."
  twrtrk.8.a:0 "We just have to let them go."
  twrtrk.81.t:0 "Tajik Independence"
  twrtrk.81.d:0 "As the situation continues to worsen in Alma-Ata, the Turkestani officials have given up on ordering the Tajik puppet regime, directly granting Tajikistan full independence, ending the unequal relationship between Turkestan and Tajikistan."
  twrtrk.81.a:0 "Another loss..."
  twrtrk.81.b:0 "Freedom!"
  twrtrk.9.t:0 "Red Army insurrection"
  twrtrk.9.d:0 "The Red Army remnants have regained the momentum. After instigating riot after riot, the Soviet loyalists have determined that it is now their time to strike. Rising up across Alma-Ata, the reformed Red Army under the command of war hero Bauyrzhan Momyshuly have launched an insurrection, attempting to overthrow the Pan-Turkic government and eventually rejoin the Soviet Union."
  twrtrk.9.a:0 "The insurrection is crushed!"
  twrtrk.9.b:0 "The red army is victorious!"
  twrtrk.10.t:0 "Alma-Ata Submits"
  twrtrk.10.d:0 "Hoping to reunify the motherland, the Red Army in Alma-Ata willingly rejoined our country."
  twrtrk.10.a:0 "Ura!"
  twrtrk.11.t:0 "Leftist Revolution"
  twrtrk.11.d:0 "The Communist remnants in Tajikistan have launched a revolution against the sitting government!"
  twrtrk.11.a:0 "Gun them down!"
  twrtrk.11.b:0 "They occupied the parliament!"
  twrtrk.51.t:0 "Central Asian Plan"
  twrtrk.51.d:0 "This morning, a group of Soviet ambassadors handed us a sounding proposal.\n\nThey suggest that, the Soviet Union is optimistic on the prospect of a possible 'Central Asian People's Republic'. It states that, the Soviet Union is willing to send an overwhelming amount of support to us if we seek to unify the recently fractured nations of Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. However, the Soviets wish to gain a chunk of the gained territory."
  twrtrk.51.a:0 "For the Central Asian People's Republic!"
  twrtrk.51.b:0 "No thanks."
  twrtrk.52.t:0 "Tajiks Refused"
  twrtrk.52.d:0 "Even with our favourable political deal, the Tajiks have refused, citing stability and recovering as their reasoning behind such an action. Our plans for Central Asia might have to be altered for now."
  twrtrk.52.a:0 "Their loss."
  twrtrk.53.t:0 "Upholding the Deal"
  twrtrk.53.d:0 "With the annexation of Uzbekistan, as the agreement entails, we must hand over Northern Uzbekistan as a gesture of appreciation for the Soviets' support in the unification war."
  twrtrk.53.a:0 "Hand them the land."
  twrtrk.54.t:0 "Central Asian-Soviet Friendship Treaty"
  twrtrk.54.d:0 "With the destruction of Uzbek nationalists, the Central Asian People's Republic has upheld our proposal. They have formally granted Soviet control over Northern Uzbekistan, in exchange for Soviet political support and resources.\n\nThe task of ruling this troubled land should be accomplished through this semi-puppet republic."
  twrtrk.54.a:0 "A Fair Deal Indeed."
  twrtrk.5001.t:0 "Unification of Kazakh SSR"
  twrtrk.5001.d:0 "After years of separation, the divided lands of Kazakhstan has finally been reunited. At long last, Soviet troops marched into former Turkestani Kazakhstan, hailed as liberators by the local Kazakhs, whom have been praying for the return of order in these lawless lands."
  twrtrk.5001.a:0 "Rejoice!"
  twrtrk.5002.t:0 "Formation of Turkmen SSR"
