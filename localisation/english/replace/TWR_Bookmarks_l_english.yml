 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "A New World"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Hitler's 'Thousand-Year Reich' under the Nazi party stands victorious in Europe, its empire spanning from Calais to Arkhangelsk. As the British Empire crumbles, the torch of democracy is passed to the rapidly growing industrial powerhouse in the United States. In the east, the Kuomintang consolidates control over China, while remnants of the Russian army regroup across the Urals and Siberia. The war ended only 5 years ago, but with the unexpectadly fragile New World Order seeing signs of collapse, nobody can know how long the perverse 'peace' will hold."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Victorious in the First World War, the United Kingdom was defeated in all but name in what it thought would be the Second. The rapid collapse of France and unending air war led most to believe victory was impossible with a Germany that now ruled all of Europe save the Soviet Union. An armistice signed in early 1941 put Britain's most immediate problems at rest, but by this time the damage was already done, and in 1952 the UK stands weak and unstable, its Empire all but gone, a lonely bastion of democracy in Europe."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Defeatism and nightmares of the Great War infested French leadership, and was a major factor in its collapse to a young Nazi Germany in 1940. With the war in the west over, the old, increasingly ill Philippe Pétain rules the new French government with nearly dictatorial power, forced to toe the line with Berlin to keep France's autonomy. However, over a decade after the end of French democracy, cries of Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité are heard through the streets, with France's weak army unable to keep down dissent. With Pétain's recent death and the ensuing power struggle only worsening the situation, it remains to be seen if Hitler's puppet in Paris can rule for long"
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Hitler's 'Thousand-Year Reich' under the Nazi party stands victorious in Europe, an empire spanning from Calais to Arkhangelsk, free to shape the continent to its will. At first glance, the iron rule of the Reich seems invincible - its armies stand supreme and the Reichskomissariats continue to colonise the new territories in the east, while all governments in Europe bow to its hegemony. However, as Hitler grows old, and the line of seccession within the party remains unclear, instability that had been forced down with military might now begin to bubble back up to the surface. The Third Reich has won, but how long can its New Order hold?"
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Italy stood alongside Germany as a victor in the War, but the mostly lackluster performance of its armies did not go down well at home. Mussoloni's dreams of a new Roman Empire have begun to be realised, boasting an expansive empire in Africa and a sphere of influence over the Mediterranean. However, old tensions with Hitler and the Nazis have bubbled back up, with the Balkans again being the centre of these new disputes. The old European Axis partners are drifting apart, and Mussoloni is determined the next war cannot be another 'humiliation'."
 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After nearly half a century, the land which now calls itself China is reaching some semblance of stability. Under Chiang-Kai Shek, the Kuomintang beat back, appeased, and subjugated warlords, eventually growing to become the dominant power in China. When the Japanese struck, China formed a United Front, holding back the invaders. When the Civil War happened, Chiang led the KMT to victory. As old Empires in the West crumble, Socialism and other radical ideologies flare up. America spreads their influence over the Pacific, and China must be a bastion of stability and peace in the far east, like they once were, and finally rid the region from foreign influence."
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The western lands of the Soviet Union, from Arkhangelsk in the north to Astrakhan in the south, lie under the rule of Germany's genocidal colonial governments. The remnants of the Red Army and the Communist Party have fled to the vast Russian steppes, its temporary capital in Perm, where soldiers and workers alike vow to liberate their comrades under the yoke of Nazism. To the far, the traitorous Russian government backed by American occupiers stands defiant, while seperatists in Siberia and the south declare 'independent' states. One day, the red banner will again fly across Russia, and the Germans will pay for their crimes."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States never joined the war in Europe, watching in horror as Nazism overran the continent, but its war against Japan kickstarted the unstoppable machine of American industry. By far the world's largest economy, the US has seen the beginnings of an unprecedented economic boom, and with rapid expansion of its vast arms industry it has earned its title as the 'Arsenal of Democracy'. As British influence flounders across the world, America must pick up the torch as Democracy's defender, and as the previously isolationist nation spreads its influence across the world, it is clear a challenger to Germany's New World Order is rising."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
 CAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Coming face-to-face with the Japanese in the Pacific, the Dominion of Canada has once again weathered the tide of war. Having emerged as host of the Toronto Accord's headquarters and a dominant player in the United Nations, The Great White North has taken a more active role in global politics; distancing itself from the weakened British Empire. Beneath the guise of a strong and prosperous nation however, social issues are bubbling away at the very heart of Canadian politics. With parliament divided on Canada's role in the Commonwealth and Quebec's growing calls for autonomy, the nation's future appears uncertain."
 AST_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"
 SAF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The South African military spent most of the Great War chasing around German forces in their African colonies, with limited success. \n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in South Africa that think the country shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendents of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualties in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the western front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the fighting overseas, and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the people of New Zealand look anxiously at the world stage, for this time, the threat of war seems to draw ever closer to their own home..."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The former crown jewel of the British Empire, the Indian Republic is a huge but unstable new nation struggling to enforce full control of the subcontinent. Born out of rebellion against their weakened British overlords, the Indian subcontinent, most of it nominally under Delhi's sovereignty, had collapsed with devestating humanitarian consequences. The axis-inspired Hindu nationalist RSS, beaten in the north, has fled into the south for a final stand, as various princely states and separatists hold onto autonomy around the country. India's charismatic and popular leader Bose, however, will not rest until the subcontinent is united and the dream of a truly free India is realised."
 GRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Invaded by Italy in 1940, Greece managed to repel the Italians and even break into Southern Albania. However, Germany's surprise intervention caused Greece to rapidly collapse, realizing Mussolini's dreams for an Italian Greece. The end of the war found Greece an impoverished and deeply destroyed country under the leadership of the 'National Union of Greece', an Italian backed puppet government keen on submitting to all Italian demands. With a devastated economy and with a large part of the countryside controlled by rebels, Greece will soon find itself embroided into another brutal conflict..."
 TRV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Established by the Soviet Union as a military district, the Kazan Military Okrug is tasked to eradicate radical elements, including the Idel-Ural separatists and the fascistic "Armed Forces for the Liberation of the Urals". These two groups controlled the area before the Soviet Union were able to reclaim it, ending the short lived Republic of Ideal Ural.\n\nSince then, the Kazan Military Okrug is operated by Ivan Konev's military staff, given almost dictatorial authority over the "reconstruction" of the region."
 IDE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "From the monstrous tragedy of the Russian Nation, there rises a new hope for the Tatar people. The rays of dawn shine upon Idel-Ural, the most glorious land in Russia. Under the enlightened guidance of the Germans, we found mercy - in exchange for keeping the supply lines running to Berlin, we have been allowed a degree of independence. Our leadership, benevolent in its control, has allowed our citizens the right to work, work and work for what they truly want: to realize the dream of a life in the oil-fields and the factories, not a life spent in decadent luxury or wasteful freedom. Rumors of a General Strike are nothing but that, rumors, and if we have to whip that fact into every last citizen, we shall do that too!"
 KRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Second Union's collapse marked a new beginning, not only for the city of Krasnoyarsk, but for Marshal Georgy Zhukov. Comprising many left-wing groups who disagreed with Zhdanov's Stalin-worship, the Krasnoyarsk Soviet Republic is united only through Marshal Zhukov. The nascent republic suffers from factionalism, as the allegedly-reactionary Sniper Clique, led by Vasily Zaytsev, frequently comes to blows with the Polish-dominated Plurinational Committee, under Andrey Vyshinsky. This factionalism, combined with a Tuvan insurgency, has poked serious holes into Zhukov's attempts to reunite Russia under his leadership. Can the Marshal succeed, or will he go down in history as a failure?"
 NOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Former capital of the Second Union, Novosibirsk briefly served as the hub for opposition against Perm. However, since the departure of Zhukov and his allies to Krasnoyarsk, the Soviet Republic of Novosibirsk was formed, led by the ailing Andrei Zhdanov. While the republic appears united, the plotters are already planning in the event of Zhdanov's eventual death. Two factions have emerged as the main competitors: Nikita Khrushchev's "reformists" and Nikolai Voznesensky's "Zhdanovists". While Zhdanov's days might be numbered, who is going to be the one to carry on his legacy?"
 BRY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "An outpost at the Russian Republic's eastern borderlands, the Buryat Military Okrug knows little beyond conflict, and is plagued with both far-left and far-right terrorism. The frontier has faced a fascist insurgency since the assassination of President Aleksandr Kerensky and a crackdown on fascism in the aftermath. To make matters worse, agrarian socialist terrorists, under the name of the long-dead Combat Organisations, make their return as leftists fighting for a nation in their own shade of red. Can General Alexei Baksheev maintain order, or shall the frontier okrug be the birthplace of a new Russia?"
 POR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "On paper, the Portuguese Empire is mighty indeed: its reach stretches across Africa and parts of Asia, spreading the beauty and honor of the homeland to deserving natives, and in the homeland Salazar rules with a benevolent grip on his people. Unfortunately, this illusion evaporates outside the propaganda channels. In truth, Salazar's regime is unpopular and only a divided opposition keeps his Fascists on top. His Empire, far from being sovereign, is a nest of spies and spycatchers where it is not in active chaos. As the winds of change sweep East and West, Portugal will face challenges everywhere - not least in the men that are supposed to secure its safety..."
 BUL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Bulgaria threw its hat into the ring relatively late in the European wars, and for its opportunism it was rewarded. Now the nation rests easy with the fruits of its conquest. The occupied territories of Thrace and Macedonia are peaceful, the Regent Kyril rules with a strong and fair hand, and all is right with the Army. That is what the Government says, anyway, but as the fascist-led Parliament and Kyril's puppemaster Hristo Lukov, backed by Germania and Rome jostle with an increasingly popular Monarchist opposition movement, it is clear that the Government is lying. The people and army of Bulgaria must soon decide which path to take to seize the future lest the great powers lurking on the European stage seize them first."
 CRO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Nestled in the western edge of the Balkans, the Croatian State has much to thank the Germans for: its generous territorial gains, economic support for the Ustase administration and its endless excesses, and the military Advisors that keep its enemies in the region suppressed. Now the Reich's strength wanes in the face of faraway troubles, however, and Croatia's minorities have only grown more embittered and violent as the bloodshed continues. If the State can keep its domestic radicals at bay and break its enemies, perhaps there is still a place in the changing world for Croatia's empire - but as the bullets lose their power, this proposition is ever more uncertain."
 MEX_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Republic of Mexico is defined by its inherent paradoxes. A child of the Revolution which pushed American corporations out of the country, it is nevertheless increasingly reliant on its northern neighbour for diplomatic and economic influence. And the Revolution has not been equal in its fruits for all Mexico's sons: the south struggles with ethnic separatism even as Mexico City makes overtures towards guardianship of the fractured Central American states - as the future beckons to North America, Mexico must overcome its legacy as an American puppet if it wishes to forge its own path into the future."
 BRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the fledgeling dictator Getulio Vargas was forced to step down and hold elections in 1945, many hoped it would be the dawn of a new day for Brazil - the new day, as it turns out, is starkly similar to the old. The issues long plaguing Brazil's economic and political systems have only worsened, with corruption pushing into the far margins of Parliament itself, and Vargas is himself back in power thanks to the incompetence of his would-be democratic successors. The nation's military looks uneasily at this state of affairs and plots rearguard maneuvers against Communism in its backyard, and Washington watches the instability with growing concern. If Vargas is to bring the nation into order, he has his work cut out for him - and if he cannot, there are plenty in line to replace him, too."
 VEN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "There is much that can be said about the Venezuelan Republic's brief foray into democracy - that it was regrettably unstable, that it threatened the military, that it would never have lasted even if Generals had not intervened - but no one can say it was less despised than the current regime. The junta, headed by Raul Jimenez, holds sway over a puppet President as elections appear on the horizon. But forecasts tell of widespread opposition support in the populace, and the election is looking increasingly unlikely as the military solidifies its grip over the legislature. Beyond this, the junta's flair for fascist rhetoric and a return to public-works building promise that the new Venezuela is shooting for national unity - whether it will achieve this aim is rather more questionable."
 RGO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Crimean peninsula was long a summer haunt of the old Prussian aristocracy - its modern descendants now run the SS-State of Gotenland, holiday resort, base of local SS Brigade operations and the Reich Model Province of 1950 (sic). Under the innovative corporate leadership of Reinhard Heydrich, the little State has become a site of technological wonders coexisting with massive commercial profiteering. Thanks to the innovative techniques of ignoring the locals and full-scale infrastructure building, it is said Gotenland could even host the rockets of tomorrow. Rumors of partisan activity and of mysterious workings in the SS garrison itself are just that, rumors - as long as Heydrich leads us, Gotenland is destined to reach new heights!"
 SBA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Were it not for the irregularities of the Reich's last advances into Eastern Europe, the little state of Banat would never have been. The region now known as Prinzeugenland was seized from Hungarian and Croatian soil as the Yugoslavians fell apart - when Berlin noticed the little territory's strategic value as a buffer between the perpetually hostile lands to the south, it secured the little territory for itself. This has not been the most popular move, to say the least, with Banat's natives and the neighbouring states. But the garrison is strong, the raiders are regularly repelled and the Volksdeutsche reign virtually unchallenged. So long as Berlin is infallible, so too will Banat remain a beacon of Aryan strength in these lands - and why would that ever change?"
 ROS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the heart of the old Baltic States, there is a land of rolling fields of grain: smiling Aryan men and women harvest it for the Reich's dinner tables, living simple lives dedicated to serving Germany in the most noble of professions, the farming industry. That is how our propaganda reels describe our work here in Ostland, but the truth is rarely so simple. While our society remains largely agrarian and settler-based, the indigenous residents seem set on destruction of the great project. While repressive measures seem successful on paper, for every Lithuanian Forest Brother we catch another ten seem to spring from the depths. The garrison from Berlin is strong but not inexhaustible - if we do not find a solution soon, the great Eastern Spaces could soon be lost to us."
 RUK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The story of the Ukrainian people in the 20th century is an unending litany of horror and pain. The latest chapter of that story was written as German troops marched into Kiev, welcomed by crowds embittered to Soviet brutality in the region - when the Reichskomissar Erich Koch was sent to govern the area, it became clear that this would be anything but liberation. Koch's paranoia, devotion to violence and total lack of concern for the people have secured Ukraine's grain fields for the Reich and precious little else, and as partisan activity continues to hollow out the Komissariat even that is now under threat. Only one thing is certain, as Koch retreats ever further into his gunfire and the cities begin to smoke: Ukrainian freedom, if it is ever to be gained, will be birthed in the death of thousands."
 RMO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As Moscow burned to the ground and the final Red Army units protecting it broke, the horror of Generalplan Ost was initiated upon West Russia's vast plains. Millions died in those first years, and the groundwork for what would become Reichskomissariat Moskowien were laid in oceans of human blood. Now a semblance of stability has been gained, in part through the brutality of Siegfried Kasche's regime and in part through the partial settlement of Germans in agricultural regions, but no one is pretending that the Slavic natives are in any way happy about it. Between the protests, the kidnappings and the occasional murders, Moskowien is stuck in a prison of its own creation, and there is no means of escape save through that which first created it - mass violence on a horrifying scale."
 RKA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Reichskommissariat Kaukasus, if indeed that is the right word for the region, is in truth a shining example of how not to govern a region: the Nazi conquests left behind a mess of partisan groups and loyalties, an economy entirely reliant on oil, and a thin garrison to sustain the illusion of German strength. Law and order is more or less a fictional construct outside of the major cities, and soldiers sent to patrol the mountains and fields outside them do not come back in one piece. The oil still flows, and the natives are not outright rebellious, but this much is certain: One day the thread holding the Caucasus Nightmare together will unravel, and on that day the German conscripts will surely prefer the embrace of hellfire to the fate that awaits them."
 ARM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Armenian people have long suffered at the hands of the conqueror and the oppressor, but as the Soviets descended into chaos we saw our chance to slip the yoke. Garegin Nazhde now leads our nation into glory, for where the Caucasus Mountains tremble with gunfire, Armenia's streets glow with opportunity and economic promise. For all its flaws, the German model of governance seems to be working well for us, and the partisan forces that stalk our borders are mostly kept at arm's length. The time is coming, however, for change: as the German garrison crumbles, the opportunity to assert our leadership of the region beckons, and to build a greater nation than our founders ever dreamed possible..."
 FFR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Germans walked into Paris, their lapdogs in Vichy begged at their table like the curs they were. France was humbled, its back bent in submission, but not the Free French! From the enclaves of West Africa we continue, our very existence a statement of spite against the treasonous regime reigning from the Paris they stole from us. Perhaps those who do not understand the intricacies of our governance say we are repressive and undemocratic - that our massive colonial military will be useless at beating back the Fascists and only does well against peaceful protestors. We will hear nothing of such lies! As long as the flag flies above Dakar, the hearts of our people shall forever be French, and we will not have it any other way!"
 SYR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Antun Saadeh is the glory of the Syrian State and the architect of its woes: when the 1940 revolution swept the French out and the SSNP in, Saadeh's dreams pushed the Syrian Army into Lebanon, breaking down the barriers built by our oppressors. But Saadeh's militant expansionism and aggressive rhetoric towards the Levantine nations came at a high price. We were forced to an armistice in wars with Israel and Palestine, and the near-collapse of our economy followed disastrous embargoes from the West. In truth, the Syrian people have grown weary waiting for Saadeh's promises of prosperity. But Saadeh is not tired of Syria, not just yet - as the armies mass on the borders, old dreams swirl of the Levant that could yet be his. And when Saadeh starts his new crusade, there will be nowhere in the Middle East to hide."
 IRQ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Jewel of the Fertile Crescent, the Kingdom of Iraq, the Cradle of Civilisation - despite the predations of the Western powers and the chaos of the world around it, Iraq remains a place of wild beauty and political diversity. King Faisal, the British puppet, sits on his throne as whispers of Syrian armies drift into Baghdad, and his advisors speak of an alliance of kings to combat the Monster of Damascus. But the winds of change do not blow in one direction alone: Ba'athist radicals and Republicans have their own plans to build a new order in the Mid-East, and the monarchists have plans of their own to redraw the borders in ways that would better suit the Crown. Iraq is a young nation, but when it is ready to forge its own path - the world awaits it, and boundless opportunity."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Japanese Empire started the war, the generals and politicians counted on the Europeans to honour the pact, but this never happened. Foolishly, Japan found herself alone against the world, fighting the British Empire, China and the United States of America in an impossible war, a  war that would result in a successful invasion on Japanese soils and four atomic bombs deployed on Japanese cities. These actions ultimately led to Japan's unconditional surrender, which placed Japan under the occupation of the Americans and dismantling the once mighty Japanese Empire.\n\nIt has been seven years since the start of the occupation, and Japan is still recovering from her wounds."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Blitzkrieg"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia. Spain is now governed by nationalists and Japan has fought both the Soviet Union and China for territory, the latter being a more successful battle for Japan. The new non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany may be bad news for the rest of Europe."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for France to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n France was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands, the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, achieved some fame as a peace keeper for his part in the Munich agreement a year ago. However, German territorial expansion has made Italy see there is more land to claim if an understanding with the Germans could be reached. \n\nAlbania has been conquered merely as a taste of Italy's military capabilities, and the rest of the world would do well to worry."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
 CAN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a mere colony and left it as a nation. Born in the mud of Passchendaele, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage. \n\nHobbled by the Great Depression and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this new nation looks anything but secure."
 AST_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"

 RAJ_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
 CZE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "During the Great War, Czech troops fought alongside the Entente forces all over Europe in an effort to secure recognition for their nation. Their efforts were successful and Czechoslovakia rose from the ashes of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. \n\nSince their explosive entry into statehood Czechoslovakia formed the 'Little Entente' alliance with Yugoslavia and Romania with the aim of suppressing Hungary's efforts to restore the Austro-Hungarian Empire, although as resurgent German power grows the political landscape of Europe is rapidly changing."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "One half of the late Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary was treated as a defeated enemy by the victorious Entente after the Great War. In the Treaty of Trianon, the country lost almost two thirds of its territory. Millions of ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside its borders, and its economy was left in ruins. Harsh restrictions on rearmament were supposed to ensure that Hungary could never again threaten the peace in Europe. \n\nBut with the political climate in Europe shifting, the time may have come to finally right the wrongs of the past, and regain the former glory of the nation."
 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Romania found herself on the winning side of the Great War, and as a result gained new territories and people - not all of whom were Romanians. To guard against the revanchionist desires of the countries that were forced to cede land, Romania has created a web of alliances all across the Balkans. In recent years, however, the country has concerned itself mostly with domestic matters, and the government of King Carol II has allowed these alliances to lapse. \n\nAs the political situation in Europe changes, Romania may well find herself standing alone - and vulnerable."

 YUG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Yugoslavia came into existence after the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes merged with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia in 1922. Initially Yugoslavia joined both the Little Entente and the Balkan Pact to secure their independence, but recently the assassination of King Alexander combined with growing internal pressure from nationalists and external pressure from Italy and Germany has caused drastic upheaval and reevaluation of their political and strategic position."

 KOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The invasion and surrender of Japan in 1945 saw Korea be free from colonial domination for the first time since 1905. With America dominant in the far east, at least for now, Syngman Rhee rose to leadership over the newly created Republic. However, while a Republic in name, Rhee rules the country almost as an autocrat, and the people yearn for real democracy, as radical forces prepare for any opportunity to seize power."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The admiral from the First World War enjoyed great power, ruling as regent of the Kingdom of Hungary, but in the end, he had to decide to join Germany in the pre-war period, and during the European war, they enjoyed great stability. But the growing German influence, both politically and economically, influenced Horthy's regime to slowly begin to lose its independence. Now that Germany is slowly falling into chaos, the Hungarian economy is also following Germany's descend. Can Hungary survive the difficult years ahead of them, or will it fall into oblivion, in the books of history?"
 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Romania, although one of the victors of the European War, came out of it with a bitter-sweet taste in its mouth, remaining under German influence, and internal shame because Greater Romania as an idea was not realized, as long as Transylvania was in Hungarian hands. Marshall Antonescu was able to successfully keep the internal affairs of Romania in his hands, but his death in 1951 was the last straw of stability that broke, and then a new idea came up. Iron Guard politicians were amnestied so they could join the government, and balance forces between independence, and Germany. Now there is only one question left, will this balance bring order and peace to Romania, or will it just bring it to its knees and destroy it?"
 NRI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Nestled in the barren, isolated lands of Northern Siberia, the Yeniseysk Governorate is the Soviet successor state most shrouded in mystery to the outside world. During the collapse of the USSR, disgruntled workers in the far northern city of Norilsk and many towns in the Yeniseysk area, and a diverse array of former GULAG inmates across the region, now isolated from the new Soviet government in Perm, formed their own cooperative government. Today, this loose confederation of settlements led by Norilsk remains an isolated outpost at the northern edge of the world."
