twrsoviet.0.t:0 "What Remains"
twrsoviet.0.d:0 "The last decade has been a complete disaster for the Soviet Union. Soviet forces fought desperately during the Great Patriotic War, but failed to hold back the invading German forces. Instead, millions of people died at the cruel hands of the Nazis, while millions more lie enslaved and oppressed, ruled by colonial Reichskommissariats that serve only to clear land for future settlement by German colonists and to crush rebellion. The catastrophic defeat has resulted in the disintegration of the Union. An American puppet rules in the Far East, and traitorous splinter governments occupy territory across central Asia and Siberia. What remains of the Soviet government retains tentative control over the Ural industrial regions. Exiled from Europe, unstable, and having lost most of its territory, effective rule will be needed to reunite the Union, liberate the millions of oppressed, and drive out the fascist menace."
twrsoviet.0.a:0 "Dark times indeed!"
twrsoviet.3.t:0 "The First Victims"
twrsoviet.3.d:0 "Perm is a cold, cold place at night. Winds from the nearby Urals buffet the town in savage gusts that have killed thousands of refugees fleeing the burning corpse of Moscow, who are still looked upon with unease by the Presidium and its staffers. Street lamps and firelight from behind thinly paned windows mark isolated pools of light in a vast black that churns with the smoke from factory chimneys. But most visitors do not complain about the dark or the cold or the industrial haze. No, what defines Perm at night is silence: oppressive, cold, and utterly deaf to the cries that break upon it. At night the silence of Perm makes even the most hardened of hunters tremble.  \nAnd so it is with proverbial fear and trembling that the family sets out into the darkness of the city's streets. Their destination is unclear, as is their purpose for going out so late. Later records will suggest that the family is going to stay at the house of a relative, possibly for a gathering or for some financial purpose (Internal Security Officers will edit this out of the records, of course - there will be no financial difficulty in the Soviet Union). Either way, they never make it there. Someone - something - falls upon them in the darkness. A struggle occurs and blood gouts upon the snow in a wide arc. Cries reach the vast, deaf and uncaring darkness, but are abruptly snuffed out.  \n\The forensic team will later note that the mother was found sprawled over her children, covering their bodies with her own. She had tried to protect them in her final moments. The father had evidently tried to crawl away, from the position of his outstretched arms. This attempt was stopped by blunt force trauma to his head, the contents of which arc across the snow in a red-pink comet's tail. As news reaches the citizens of Perm in scandalised and terrified whispers, the darkness seems to grow just a little colder, and a little more silent."
twrsoviet.3.a:0 "What monster could have done this?"
twrsoviet.4.t:0 "The Manhunt"
twrsoviet.4.d:0 "Policemen in the Soviet Union are seldom called to investigate murders: in the days of Beria, most cases of premeditated homicide were simply left to molder with the corpses in the mortuaries, as the shadow of the NKVD lurked over everything and everyone. The terror stifled men - occasionally it strangled them outright, and for some it did far worse than strangle - and it haunts the Union even now, for nobody wishes to be caught with politically inconvenient truths. That way lies a quick grave and a hastily written suicide note.\n\nAnd so it is with a disturbing enthusiasm that the Forensics Department rouses from its semi-retirement to investigate the crime. The bodies have been sent to the morgue, rudimentary equipment drawn from long-buried caches, and a team of detectives gathered. The killer, whoever he is, will be found, tried before the people, and enter records as an Enemy of the People. It is time to show the Russian people that Soviet police are more than the punchline of jokes!\n\nAn announcement is made across Perm and the Soviet Union at large, declaring the suspect a state criminal, offering a bounty for his capture, and requiring members of the public with information regarding his physical appearance and whereabouts to come forth. As it turns out, the generosity of the Russian people is as overabundant as ever, as police spend days tabulating masses of wildly inconsistent and highly implausible data.\nNevertheless, a small but growing pile of evidence from the crime scene is being reviewed. Name by name, the list of potential suspects shrinks… and there will only be so many names to strike before one is left."
twrsoviet.4.a:0 "The plot thickens!"
twrsoviet.5.t:0 "Smoke, Grease, Blood"
twrsoviet.5.d:0 "For Detective Akimov it is another day in the smoky innards of the Forensics Department in Perm Police Headquarters, and he is not looking forward to his change of shift. He pretends to read a report, one of many on the Perm 'Midnight Killings', as they have since become known. He notes the time and the details gathered with an ease borne of practice - the killer was evidently experienced with the use of blunt force, and the clinical lethality of the quadruple homicide reminds him of the actions of the Cheka. Shuddering, he wills idea away - some thoughts are too dangerous to entertain, even for a man in his position. Presently, he is interrupted by a functionary. Something big has happened.  \nThe walk to the unnamed house is unremarkable, but as he approaches it Akimov can smell the greasy, ashen scent of charred meat. And it doesn't smell like beef or chicken. He enters the house easily: the door nearly falls off its hinges, so much of its frame has melted, and the scene within... Akimov just barely manages to hold in the contents of his stomach. It is a compliment to his training that he can survey the scene with a level head. The remains of a child are smeared across the floor of the room in a wide arc. The cuts in his body are deep enough to split bone, and his crushed skull displays the use of blunt force: perhaps the child struggled as he was burned. Overwhelmingly, a suffocating smoke and the stench of grease - a nightmare from a children's storybook, in a chapter only opened to those who are worst-behaved and whispered into prickling ears. And in the centre a bloody smudge of viscera, like a child piling food in a pile in the middle of his plate.  \nThe detective's spectacles drop to the floor. He bends to pick them up, gagging, and as places them back on his clammy nose he notices a glint of light in the corner of the room. He walks to the source, reaches out for it. His jaw drops..."
twrsoviet.5.a:0 "In his hand, an NKVD pistol, still bloody, marked: V. ABAKUMOV."
twrsoviet.6.t:0 "The Capture"
twrsoviet.6.d:0 "Viktor Abakumov was never popular even as a free man: his reputation for violence and brutality (coupled with a profundity of rumours about his womanising antics) alienated him from even his fellow terror-apparatchiks in the NKVD, and his close alliance with Beria made him an object of suspicion and hatred in the post-Beria years. Unfortunately for most of the Politburo, the enduring presence of the security apparatus made it hard for open hatred to be expressed on the floor of the Presidium, and so whispered references and veiled allegories had to suffice.  \nNo longer. Now that the true savagery of the 'Butcher of Perm' is exposed, there is no need to hide the disgust, the loathing and the hatred. As Abakumov is captured from his hiding-hole 25 miles from Perm and dragged to face trial, the speeches denouncing him are already being written. And these speeches will hold nothing back.  \nIn a record-breaking 7-hour trial, Abakumov is dragged through the mud, sentenced to multiple counts of murder (it turns out flakes of paint on the pistol were left at both the 'Midnight Murders' and the 'House of Charred Meat', as the scenes of the crime have been labeled by the press) and stripped of everything save his humanity, since one cannot take away what has already been lost. The entire Presidium unites (a rare occurrence indeed!) in condemning his actions, and offers only the mercy of a quick death.  \nAs the shots ring out in the courtyard, passers-by can hear the screams and whimpers that will pass for a last will and testament. Viktor Abakumov, the leader of Socialism on Earth, spends his last moments begging and crying to see his mother - and then silence. But, of course, nobody listens. There is little need to listen to a rabid dog, and even less reason to answer its final pitiful barks. The bullet is sufficient."
twrsoviet.6.a:0 "He did not deserve a clean death."
twrsoviet.7.t:0 "In the Halls of a Broken Nation"
twrsoviet.7.d:0 "The Kremlin's halls lie in a broken shadow. A lone man walks along the corridors, a singular room in mind. A door is reached; a placard reading 'General Secretary of the Communist Party' lies broken on the ground beside it. The man passes through the doorway and stands in the room beyond, his face in tears.\n\nAndrei Sakharov has awaited this moment for many years. Since his exile by Beria he has traveled the former Soviet territories, a broken man. But he found he could not run from the issues he had once addressed. Following the eruption of anti-Soviet riots he returned, and this morning he had led the largest single protest in the postwar history of the Union. A gamble, he knew, for protesting against the Kremlin was unwise to even the most brave.  \nHe never could have hoped for such an outcome. With the simultaneous eruption of similar protests in every major city, the Soviet state apparatus collapsed. All across the Union, military bases have been abandoned, government offices looted and police stations burned. A provisional government has been formed in Perm, and has declared Sakharov its chairman. \nHe is still readier for this opportunity then they can imagine. Sakharov has fought, bled, and risked it all for Russia. It is time every Russian does the same. Already, Sakharov has begun preparations for an All-Russian Unification Congress. In the near future, Russia may once again be united."
twrsoviet.7.a:0 "By one man's will, are we all saved?"
twrsoviet.8.t:0 "Not with a Bang…"
twrsoviet.8.d:0 "Kruglov is not a man the average Red Army Guard wishes to cross paths with, especially now that he is in control of the two most dreaded institutions in the Soviet government: the Politburo and the NKVD. Despite his mild demeanour, the terror of absolute control makes him virtually unapproachable by even his closest advisors. The endless gossip that runs like tendrils through the Guards' headquarters is filled with speculation about the fate of his enemies. Kruglov, like Beria before him, is a soothing voice, a lowered gaze, a whispered half-truth in an uncomfortably quiet hallway. He is fear itself, and so all his steps are shadowed, no matter how gentle they may be.  \n\nBecause of the fear he instills, the men who are sent to guard his room are usually the lowest of the low; men guilty of severe disciplinary infractions or the cardinal sin of playing the wrong hands in office politics. Dyatlov and Timurovich are two such perpetrators of the latter variety, and they silently lament their shared misfortune as the cold Ural breeze sweeps over Kruglov's personal quarters. Dyatlov gestures to Timurovich, indicating the violent treatment he wishes to exact upon those who have brought him here, and in Timurovich's silent laughter the unassuming thump, like a paperweight falling off a desk to rest on a carpeted floor, is lost.  \n\nBut as time passes, slowly it dawns upon the guards that something is very wrong. Kruglov has not been out for some time now, and now that they are listening closely... hasn't the room been silent for a while? No snoring, no scribbling, no shuffling the way Director-Secretary does when he's writing a memo or list. Nothing. In a panic, medics are dialed and the room is stormed to find an unconscious Kruglov lying on the carpet, his expression blank and peaceful. It is quickly determined that he has suffered a potentially fatal aneurysm. One doctor asks the increasingly hysterical Guards approximately how long Kruglov has gone without treatment, and the Guards respond:"
twrsoviet.8.a:0 "1 hour."
twrsoviet.8.b:0 "3 Hours!"
twrsoviet.8.c:0 "Nearly 12 Hours!"
twrsoviet.9.t:0 "Mad King, Mad Courtier"
twrsoviet.9.d:0 "Zaytsev watches with pity and a growing sense of rage. It is hard to watch the circus show which is Kruglov's antics without disappointment and anger these days. They are hilarious and depressing in equal measure, and while the Politburo may stand silent in its witness to the madness, Zaytsev can find no such fortitude. There is nothing admirable about Kruglov screaming vitriol at Enemies of the State who have not existed in decades - the ghosts of Trotsky and Bukharin - nor in the illegible lists that he scrawls on repurposed toilet paper, and which are immediately disposed of by NKVD Guards. There is nothing admirable about a leader broken with madness, only sadness and fear for the nation he has left empty at the helm.  \n\nZaytsev was a marksman, in a long-ago time and a far-away place, and there he had watched the old Union die a slow death. No matter how many bullets he put into the enemies in front of him, the commissars had constantly sounded the order to retreat. Now he understands why: the soldiers fighting for their homeland were too cowardly, or perhaps too brave, to turn around and face the madmen behind their lines. Weakness at the top led to the collapse of the whole rotten structure, and Russia had paid the price in blood and misery and the taste of German boots. Zaytsev had stood helpless then. He will not stand helpless again.  \n\nHe gathers the men who are willing to save the Union - and there are many willing soldiers, even from within the NKVD. 'Such is the price of courage,' he tells them. 'The Union is worth any betrayal, and any sense of honour or self-worth should be sacrificed for the Soviet workers who will suffer in our inaction. For Russia to live, Kruglov must die!' The conspirators nod collectively, and Zaytsev begins to lay down the foundations of a plan. Night sweeps across the Urals, and brings with it a savage cold - and the measured voices in a little house are swept up in the wind, and disappear."
twrsoviet.9.a:0 "Save the Union from itself."
twrsoviet.10.t:0 "The Bloodless Coup"
twrsoviet.10.d:0 "The Military Action, as it will later be termed, is remarkably quick and decisive. One minute, Kruglov is demanding Stalin be summoned from the grave and shot again to ensure his ghost stops haunting the Soviet people; the next, he is being bound, gagged and dragged from the Politburo, to the surprise and mild consternation of its members. In Kruglov's place, Zaytsev seizes the podium and begins an infamous speech which outlines the theoretical foundations of what will become known as Traditionalist-Socialism and frames his agenda as a reaction to Kruglov's madness.  \n\nZaytsev speaks of the collapse of the workers' capacity to develop revolutionary self-consciousness under the NKVD and of the nightmare that is centralised control in the hands of a madman. The obvious solution is to retreat from this, to create a new brand of Socialism, built not on Modern Terror but on beliefs old as the bones of Vladimir himself - something that can truly belong to the Russian people, body, soul and perhaps heart as well. It is a compelling speech, and few notice the NKVD Guards being taken to the courtyard, although the rounds of gunshots and accompaniments of screaming and sobbing are unavoidably loud.  \n\nBy the end of the week, as NKVD members still resisting confession are dragged from their cells and redoubts. The Politburo has come to accept their new leader. He might have radical ideas, and he might have unsettling beliefs about the role of functionaries like themselves - but he is indisputably better than a madman, and perhaps a visionary is what Russia needs right now. As the bodies are buried, it is possible to believe, with some flexing of the imagination, that Russia is on the way to a better future, built on the still-mouldering corpse of the old."
twrsoviet.10.a:0 "To a new Union, a new Russia - and a new hope."
twrsoviet.11.t:0 "I was Blind, but now I See"
twrsoviet.11.d:0 "Kruglov paces around the room that he can no longer see, using the sound of his loafers to guide him. It is funny how certain senses have sharpened immeasurably in the days since his aneurysm and sudden blindness. With the loss of his sight many things have become lost, muddled forever - he will forever be handicapped in climbing the stairs, or reaching for a radio knob, or watching a theatre performance. But other things have become clear to him, so very clear. How could he have remained blind for so long? How did the bloodstreams pass his desk in an implacable tide as he signed the laws and endless lists headed for their source? How could he make this better? How could he make it right?  \n\nOutside, Red Guards whisper about the sudden, alarming new ideas the Director-Secretary has been overheard expressing, thoughts so dangerous they do not bear repeating. These beliefs are all wildly hopeful to the point of delusion, but they capture a certain desperate hope on the part of the Red Army. A few commissars express the same sentiments in their personal notes, far from prying eyes and ears, for the NKVD is hardest towards its own. Hope spreads like wildfire, faster than sound or smoke on the great steppes of the East. And soon this hope is vindicated.  \n\nOn a crystal-clear morning in Perm Central Square, Kruglov makes his next speech. Thousands turn out to watch by order of the Politburo, and many more watch in People's Theatres across the Union's vast lands. Kruglov doesn't just satisfy reformist desires; he blows them all away, with one soft and simple and impossibly sweet word, said over and over and emphasised, almost like Kruglov is feeling the word in his mouth for the first time, slowly coming to terms with it: Kalininism. The Union's salvation then - and the Union's future now."

sovpowerstruggle.0.d:0 "Early this morning, our General Secretary Lavrentiy Beria has been found dead in his dacha. It has been reported that he was unresponsive when one of his bodyguards attempted to wake him. The reported cause of death is blood loss, with his genitals allegedly being bitten off by a woman performing oral sex on him late last night. Soon after, the Politburo was notified and its members have, with a unanimous vote, established a provisional government and begin the session to vote on a new leader.\n\nAcross the Union, citizens have been both disgusted and pleased by the news, with some even celebrating. While police officers are ordered to suppress any acts of open celebration, reports suggest that local authorities have generally turned a blind eye on this issue."

sovpowerstruggle.1.t:0 "The Future of the Union Debates Commence!"
sovpowerstruggle.1.d:0 "The Politburo is unified in thought and purpose, a cohesive instrument guiding the Russian people into the harsh dawn of an uncertain world. There is no room for disagreement, no room for compromise. The People's Vanguard, in other words, is locked into a unity as pure and glassy as the surface of the polished floors of the Perm Central Party Headquarters. This is the official line - a line that none dare question, for even if the NKVD is absent the Party apparatus continues to operate with a cold efficiency. It is an inspiring vision, if a little mechanical. It is also false.  \n\nIn a locked room far from the noise and life of Perm the illusion of unity breaks like morning wind upon the Ural steppes. The pretence having fallen, bitter factionalism becomes the order of the day, with the defining cliques of Soviet politics forming around the core candidates: Bulganin, Konev, Molotov, Kruglov, Zhukov. Here, at last, the Party stance on issues so sensitive they are verboten to discuss outside the Politburo itself can be discussed without fear of the executioner's noose. Here the future of the Soviet Union, and of the Russian Motherland, stands on trial.  \n\nDespite Beria's clear preference for Kruglov, little can be done to influence the course of debate itself: statutes set down by Kalinin have ensured some degree of accountability on the part of the NKVD, making the shutting-down of rhetoric too tedious to bother with. The factions have also achieved rough parity in terms of support, perhaps the clearest sign of legitimacy of this entire process: it might be chaotic, it might even descend into anarchy, and many people will be labelled reactionary-roaders, but the Soviet Union will be defined on level ground. The Politburo prepares its notes, and by extension its gossip. The debates are coming soon."
sovpowerstruggle.1.a:0 "To the victor belong the spoils."
sovpowerstruggle.2.t:0 "Future of the Union Debates: Unification"
sovpowerstruggle.2.desc:0 "The Politburo, in the best interests of the Russian people and the proletarian struggle, has chosen for its first issue of debate a relatively safe topic: unification. Virtually the only thing that all candidates can agree on is that the Russian lands must be unified, and under the authority of the Perm government; everything else is up for debate. The main problem with unification, military means notwithstanding, is that the Union will have to adapt to ruling over vast lands still weary of Stalin's yoke and embittered with the tight grasp of the regime - and its swift near-collapse in German hands. How do you rule a people you failed to defend? Is trust even possible in such circumstances?  \n\nThe Politburo is not used to debates with such incendiary ferocity, and certainly not debates of such tremendous length. For hours the debate rages, before it arrives at a bottleneck: the definition of the word 'Union'. What is the scope of federal control in a land as diverse and confusing as Russia? Should suzerainty be limited to administrative matters, or should the centralised government rule directly? If provinces are to be ruled under federal district governments, how tight a leash should the government use to rein them in? And should governors have legitimate political authority?  \n\nThe crucible fizzes. Candidates circle around one another like vultures, snapping and drawing blood at the first sign of weakness. There is no clear winner, no clear loser: in the end it falls to the Politburo to define the bottleneck for the candidates, as per Politburo procedure. The conclusion of the debate hangs on the response."

sovpowerstruggle.3.desc:0 "Preservation of the Union: the subject was so controversial it nearly got vetoed by the Beria-NKVD for its implication that Soviet Socialism was somehow imperfect, before Beria was convinced by a gathering of his Advisors to let the matter be discussed. Nevertheless, a subject that is dangerous is almost certainly important for the precise reason that it is dangerous, and thereby calls to question the fundamentals of the Union and the laws it follows. What can be reformed? What can be thrown out? What is worth preserving? Only the most hushed of voices dare to ask this, but a clamp on free speech will not make reality go away, and the Union is worth everything, even treasonous thoughts.  \n\nAgain the debate simmers and boils at irregular intervals. The Institutions of the Politburo and The Central Committee are above reproach, of course, but the role of the apparatchik bureaucracy is hotly contested from the start. Many have observed that the old Stalin-era jokes about inept and corrupt officials are still alive and kicking precisely because the officials have remained inept and corrupt - perhaps the bureaucracy should be reformed into different ministries, even privatised. Or perhaps the answer is stricter control, the creation of sister agencies to ensure the will of the state is carried out. Perhaps a mixture of the two? Or perhaps the bureaucracy should be done away with altogether, and its functions decentralised?\n\nThe debate hits a bottleneck once again, and the Politburo must decide.

The motion is passed with extreme reluctance, the experts brought in from the Ministry of the Interior, the paperwork checked for handy statistics to throw at ideological opponents. The debate is joined, on a cold and wintry night in the bowels of the Perm Central Headquarters, for the livelihoods of the Russian people.  \n\nThe debate jumps and skips upon the use of statistics and information, as candidates scramble to prove that the New Economy Policy or the Four Year Plans were the perfect state of economic organization, the critical instrument in leading Soviet Russia to collapse, or somewhere in between. Data piles up to the point of exhaustion - who is keeping tabs on the Russian people's standards of living and does the market guarantee those standards? What does it mean to push for liberalisation and decentralised markets in a land where maybe 30 percent of the population are literate and capable of advanced-labor jobs? No one can agree, in a trend that is quickly becoming a weary predictability for the Politburo.  \n\nThe Politburo watches as the candidates begin to attack each other's stances, weaving a composite fabric - a common narrative of economic development that will shape the victorious candidate's economic policy.

The motion is carried and thick books of theory are taken, skimmed through and quickly cast aside in favour of much easier readers compiled by Ideological Officers.  \n\nThe debate is joined and quickly broadens to seemingly endless depths and horizons. What is the Classless Society? Is the vanguard still necessary in its current form and if not, how can it be made relevant to the new circumstances of a fragmented Russia? Ideological agendas fatally weakened the capability of Stalin's government to give compelling feedback, so should the Party work to decouple the ideological agenda from its current aims, or should it double down while ensuring that the Leader is kept accountable for his failings? Who wields control of governmental affairs, Leader, Party, Bureaucratic Apparatus or some combination of the three?  \n\nTwenty six hours later, debate is adjourned.

The Politburo is not superhuman and its stores of courage are in short supply after the last debate's proceedings, but the motion is eventually passed after heavy strong arming on the part of the NKVD (who have apparently decided that now is the appropriate time to begin giving the Politburo a choice in their own direction). With guarded glances and worried comments about whether Beria is looking too closely at one's immediate corner of the room, the debate is joined.  \n\nWhat does socialism look like? Must it be tailored to local circumstances? Guarded with force? Can liberalisation be entrusted to the people below the Party, or must it be led from above? What stage will the Classless Society appear at, and until that point comes who must guard the Revolution, and transmit it like a beacon into distant nights? As the day lengthens some dare to venture further still: perhaps if the people are not ready, it is whispered, a need to transition to the preceding stage is the only factor capable of catalysing a successful revolution. After all, is not the existence of the NKVD proof that ideological consciousness is fundamentally flawed in the people on some fundamental level? And if that is so...what need has Russia of the Party, or the Controlled Economy, or even of the Vanguard?  \n\nThis last debate is the most intense, and on several separate occasions fistfights nearly break out over screaming delegates accusing each other of betraying Russia.

In their places comes fear, and tightened lips and begrudging nods. Today the Politburo acknowledges Konev, but it will never like him. Konev doesn't care - it isn't love that won him the debates, and it won't be love that secures him his seat.  \n\nKonev's militant, near-brutal responses were not initially considered favourable to the Union, or even to the Politburo's long term health, but in the end the tragic necessities of the Present Circumstances of the Revolution proved sufficient reason to favour his responses. Konev will sacrifice much in the way of freedom. He might even sacrifice the quiet and isolated liberties that are the last true possessions of the Soviet Citizen, of speech, thought and much more. But will it have been worth it? Konev certainly thinks so, as he assures the audience in his acceptance speech. Anything is worth the Sanctity of the Union, and the Reunification of the Rodina.  \n\nFormalities are exchanged, the old levers in the Constitution pulled and the buttons pressed. Handover ceremonies are tedious, if only because they are transactions of informal as well as formal portfolio - so much detail remains to be sifted through, and so much more remains to be done. The new era is uneventful for the Russian people, but in the new Premier's Office, well, it will not be uneventful for quite a while.In a faraway office of the NKVD, a dossier is examined and set back in its cradle, hopefully never to be touched again.

His calmness in the face of adversity and his lucid (if a touch authoritarian) stance on the issues of the day have won him the debates, a fact which everyone is more or less content with - again, Kruglov is an easy man to deal with in person, and if it were not for the terror apparatus on his back he might even be likeable. Even as he is, he remains a firmly solid choice for Premier and one the Politburo can rally behind without much fuss.  \n\nKruglov performed admirably in the debates, with his centrist, controlled stance on hot-blooded issues making him a natural fit for the role of Premier, as well as a genuine candidate for Most Level-Headed Man In The Politburo. In a closed-doors speech, he has vowed to maintain the institutions which have made the Union strong before and will no doubt lead it to greatness in future times. This includes the Beriaist institutions and the silent graves innumerable that follow its wake - another unstated truth, and inconvenient to acknowledge in person, but if one has done nothing wrong… there is nothing to fear.  \n\nThe formalities are exchanged, the old levers in the Constitution pulled and the buttons pressed.

sovpowerstruggle.10.d:0 "There are a hundred and one things to be said about the once-Marshal, now Premier Georgy Zhukov. Many are too rude to say in public. None, however, involve cowardice. Zhukov's outright boldness in demanding reforms, unique bluntness in saying where these reforms will hurt and almost cultic magnetism has aided his already robust policy platform, and the intense, unswerving focus on the unity of the Russian people certainly swayed the crowds to the point of swooning. Zhukov has won the debate; more accurately, he has seduced the audience into believing his victory.  \n\nZhukov promises a greater and stronger Russian People, anchored on the Socialist Ideal as much as they are rooted in the Russian Way. He outlines his plans for Russia in brief: they are bold, they are intense and they have many, many, many red arrows, pointing at external and internal enemies. Troop counts. Supply lines. Maneuvers. Military marching seems to echo with his voice until, at the last part of his speech, Zhukov leans across the podium, dispenses entirely with the microphone and screams that Russia will walk all over everyone who has ever wronged them, damn them all to hell! And when Russia is done trampling their enemies to dust, that's when they'll know they'll be great again! The crowd, naturally, goes wild, and several women faint from the overwhelming presence. It is almost religious in its intensity.  \n\nZhukov doesn't just walk into the Premier's seat: he takes ownership of it, issuing curt orders and barking commands in an office that looks increasingly military by the day. As the sounds of martial music echo across Perm, the faraway office of the NKVD rings with the rustle of old armaments being frantically cleaned and restored to usable status, and the occasional panicked yell. With any luck, they'll defend their station long enough for the dossiers to burn, and maybe they'll even have enough bullets left to off themselves before Zhukov gets his hands on them."

sovpowerstruggle.11.d:0 "Vyacheslav Molotov is still, after all these years in the Soviet Cabinet, a man of some mystery. How could he have been anything else? Molotov has only survived this long in the Byzantine politics of the Union's top circles precisely because he is an enigma, one who keeps his intentions wrapped in a thick curtain of politeness and semi-seclusion. So it is with some degree of respectful surprise that the announcement comes: Molotov has won the debates. His ability to capture the economic and political issues with both an urgency for reform, and an ever-present awareness of the ...options remaining for the Union should that reform fail, managed to secure the loyalty of most of the Politburo.  \n\nMolotov is simple, succinct, forward. He declares that the Union deserves change, if only to keep itself alive, and outlines basic reform plans in his speech. These plans are roughly viable, even if they do seem a little problematic with execution: a little too broad-strokes, a little over-stretching. For the few that notice, little can be done. Molotov is the people's choice, and how could the people be wrong? Is not the dream's biggest quality one of subtle fantasy, ideals painted so bright that they outshine the drabness of the real? Why question that, unless one has something to hide? And so the confusion is choked down throats until it disappears. Perhaps they're mistaken, anyway. Who can tell?  \n\nFormalities are exchanged, the old levers in the Constitution pulled and the buttons pressed. Handover ceremonies are tedious, if only because they are transactions of informal as well as formal portfolio - so much detail remains to be sifted through, and so much more remains to be done.

sovpowerstruggle.12.d:0 "Bulganin was never the most promising of the candidates involved in the Debates, with his terrifyingly bold criticism of just about every aspect of the Soviet system, but in a miracle to beat all miracles he has emerged triumphant. A series of Policy formulations, frank statements of fact, outright impressive debate maneuvers and generally shrewd wordplays has pushed the Politburo, almost against their conscious will, to the support of the man they call the Great Neo-Reactionary. The Politburo suit can barely believe his own words as he passes the podium to Bulganin, and it shows; nobody is prepared for this, least of all Bulganin himself.  \n\nBulganin's initial disbelief only lasts till the beginning of his speech. He begins to lay out the outlines of a doctrine that is too hard to put into words, for now: but even its barest form is so incendiary, so beyond the pale, that the Apparatchiks can barely believe what they're hearing. In the heart of Soviet Socialism, the candidate for Premiership is championing a Reform of the Soviet system so radical, so aggressive and so fast it sounds like a planned dissolution. The end of Central Planning? The acceleration of New Economic Policies and the transition to privately-owned industry? The end of the reliance on Marxist theory? Scarcely is the speech finished when the Politburo rises in uproar, decrying the appearance of a leader that wants nothing better than to preside over the quick and painless suicide of the system that brought him into power. But many do not rise: they sit, nodding, and the thoughts in those quiet heads will outlast by far the chaos outside.  \n\nThe NVKD Office far away from Perm listens, mostly mute. Muffled shouts and hounded cries over phone lines are easily lost in the endless snap of the cold. One might hear, if one strains one's ears, the crackle of bellowing flames, and with it smell the scent of burning dossier-papers."

Everyone knew the old fox was hiding things (it'd have been more suspicious if he hadn't been) but closet Stalinism? Did the man learn nothing from the Great Flight Of The Bureaucrats? There is no small bitterness at the realisation that the Politburo as a whole has exercised its first measurable executive action since the formation of the Soviet Union, in faraway Petrograd, only to have it nearly wrested away from them by one of their oldest members. But bitterness is not always useless, nor is all horror invariably futile.  \n\nThe vacuum must be filled, the office cannot be left vacant. Politburo members stand unenthusiastically at podiums and announce the beginning of a new round of debates. Three candidates have been drafted from the depths of the Politburo, and special care has been taken to ensure these are all reformist. Mistakes are embarrassing, but only crippling if they are repeated. Yuri Orlov, the youthful leader of the student movement, has been elected in a special procedure by the reformist faction of the Politburo to engage in debate, as well as Frida Vigdorova (known to her foes as The Social Democratic Fascist) and Fyodor Ivanov (using the German name is a sure way to ensure his followers never speak to you again). Again, the stakes are that of the Premier's seat itself - perhaps the loss of Molotov has made this transition even more critical for the Russian people.  \n\nThe Politburo gathers and steels itself.

sovpowerstruggle.14.d:0 "The debates begin with a safely non-controversial topic: the issue of True Soviet Democracy. The topic is so non-controversial, in fact, that the Politburo takes the added steps of removing any handheld blades or heavy objects from the delegates before they are allowed to enter the chamber. Molotov's brief election and fall from grace left so much vitriol in the delegates, and so much dissension remains amongst the divisive Politburo factions as to how to comprehend his treason, that it is believed this debate will serve a purgative function and as a means of closure. It is doubtful how cathartic this will actually be, but one must try one's best…  \n\nThe candidates greet the Politburo, engage in a brief dialogue introducing their agendas, and begin. The debate takes off from a slow initial start, as all candidates begin developing their vision of how the People should be represented in a system that has not actually represented the workers in anything but name for decades. Soviet Democracy is agreed to represent the people's vision, to embody its work and to protect the working revolutionary class unto the eventual triumph of the Revolution. After that, however, all bets are off. Freedom for the workers might dismantle the Revolution that was paid for with so much blood, while limits risk choking the spirit of the Soviet System in its own red-tape. Councils? Leaders? Unions and factories? What is the basic unit of Democracy and how can they be represented? Factionalism nearly killed Russia once - how can it be stopped, or at the very least reined in?  \n\nDebate rages through the night. The Politburo, as they are accustomed to doing, takes notes. Eventually a phrase, circled and jotted, becomes prominent, and alongside it the words: CLEAR WINNER."

The long shadow of the NKVD falls heavy over this question. Men with guns overseeing the proceedings of governmental affairs are not generally liked, whether they claim allegiance to the Red Army or to the Security Services. Even so, the machinations of Molotov have convinced most that a clearly defined role in politics is critical for the Army to know when to step in and when to hold back, what is worth intervening in and in what circumstances. Much hangs in the balance, including the stability of the Soviet System. No government can long withstand a politically active and distrustful military, especially not with Reconstruction pressing on its hands.  \n\nThe candidates circle around this question, taking care to avoid speaking of the real issues - let the other candidates take care of it, or at least that is how it is interpreted. Eventually they take the plunge, and debate centres quickly around 2 main issues: the Constitution and the Chief of Staff. The Constitution might provide a safe-door for interventionist actions in the case of tyranny, inclusive of military control of the arms of government and deposition of the Chairman. However, the Constitution also demands that the principles of Soviet democracy be respected, which would obviously be impossible if the interests of the Army and the Executive were misaligned. Furthermore, the Chief of Staff of the Army, responsible in theory for guiding all military action, is either apolitical or a fervent loyalist to the Politburo, depending on who one asks.  \n\nDebate continues well into the night, with frequent interjections from the audience, especially those involved in the Red Army. It appears that the issue will remain intractable for quite a long time, as vague definitions make individual interpretations wildly variant. Nevertheless, one line of thought carries the day."

sovpowerstruggle.16.d:0 "Out with the old, in with the new. The Marxist theory that sustained the Union for so long has survived only in union with the Leninist theory that allowed for its application to a complicated and often sub-optimal geopolitical situation. This Marxist theory, furthermore, was often ignored in favour of routine political decision-making in the early years of the Union. Now that the Soviet System is entering a new age with vastly different circumstances, it might be time to consider developing a Socialist Theory that relies not on Marx but on the insights gained from running what is left of the Union. It might be time, in other words, to develop Socialism with Uniquely Russian Characteristics.  \n\nTo state this out loud is tantamount to treason, of course, and so the theorists do not state it out loud. Instead they vote for the question to be posed to the candidates, in a reassuring form, to ensure their minds are on the future and their hearts are aligned to the interests of the people. The candidates debate and skip across the broad expanse of most of Socialist Theory, focusing on an internal critique: how helpful has Marxism been in Soviet internal development, and can its utility said to be timeless? The centre of Marxist theory, of course, is the notion of the Classless Society, the eventual end-goal, but the role of the Vanguard Party in reaching this goal is also debatable. Thesis, antithesis, synthesis. By throwing Theory at each other, it is believed that the candidates will eventually arrive at a unified conclusion.  \n\nThe candidates are more than prepared to answer the question, but no one can agree, in the end, on how to reconcile their visions, or even objectively judge them. The debate gutters out. Even so, a winner must be chosen - and one line of thinking is more accepted than the others."

Nobody, least of all the candidates themselves, wants to go through another exhaustive debate on theory that may as well be written in melting snow until the actual Reunification.  \n\nThe extension of the debate to allow for additional research pays rich dividends, however. On the day of the debate all candidates show up armed with thick pamphlets of theory, backed up with statistics and analyses from the Think-Tanks (buried under the thick strata of Soviet Economic Planning Division paperwork records), and the debate gets off to a strong start. All candidates, in true socialist fashion, have formed theses to clash with antitheses in the hope of finding an eventual synthesis. It's a perfect plan. After all, Marxist economic theory fits economic and societal structures like a glove, and so there can't possibly be any doubt as to the eventual synthesis this will produce, can it?  \n\nExcept it doesn't work. In 8 hours of frenzied debate all 3 candidates not only demonstrate the fundamental incompatibility of the other 2 candidates' theories with their own, but also develop their theories to their logical conclusions. In despair, the panel elected to come to a conclusion about the candidates breaks with tradition and opens the question directly to the floor.

Orlov breaks with tradition once again in directly addressing the crowd even before the speech begins, and is almost drowned out by the cheering throughout. He lists, as his goals for Premiership, 5 areas of critical importance where, as he calls it, 'the black tape of the Red Banner' has strangled the voice of the Soviet People - and he produces a pair of scissors, snapping enthusiastically as he calls for all of the tapes to be cut.  \n\nOrlov promises bold, even radical reform, and more importantly he promises that the decisions to make these reforms shall truly lie with the Soviet people, not anonymous apparatchiks plotting in the name of the Soviet Republic. He promises economic revitalization, a move away from the stagnation of the planned economy, and a vitality of private industry and commerce. He promises the permanent end of the NKVD, in all its twisted roots curled around the Motherland's institutions and its chokehold over the Soviet heart. He promises a return to infrastructure and technology, a literal rebuilding of the hearths and laboratories of the Soviet land as its people rise anew in strange freedom. He promises that through it all, the youth shall have a voice in running a new Russia, looking to the past for inspiration but always destined for the future.  \n\nAnd the people roar with affirmation. The new Premier is formally elected from a one-name list of candidates, raised to the highest office in the land - and jubilation explodes across the battered nation.

If anyone still holds to these thoughts, they do not voice them as the ceremony begins for his formal ascension to the State's highest office. One thing is clear: Fyodor Ivanov has had much to overcome - but he has overcome it all.  \n\nHis Russian still ever-so-slightly accented in places, Fyodor begins to speak on the unity of the people, on the beauty of the Russian land and the essential link that socialism provides between soil and blood. He reminds the audience of the glories of Russia past, and sadly dismisses the present era as one of degeneration brought about by non-socialist, non-Russian elements. If there is a thread to be found here that connects past to present to future, it must be found here, in the lifeblood of the State: the will of the people drove Socialism in its purest form during the Great Patriotic War, albeit to a regrettable conclusion, and perhaps, if it could be harnessed once again…  \n\nHis speech reaches a patriotic crescendo, as Ivanov promises the unity of the Motherland, and henceforth the defeat of the Hated Old Enemies in Berlin-Germania, with the people's will honed to a razor-sharp end pointed at the world. The people's fist must hit hard, it must hit fast, and the punches must land all at once - there, in the united expression of strength, lies the Socialist future. The people clap politely as he is elected, and if anyone expresses doubt, he does so in his or her own head. After all, if the leader's vision is not true, how can anything else be but false?"

sovpowerstruggle.21.d:0 "A Soviet saying goes like this: bureaucracy is the hand of the people, warm, strong and wrapped around its own throat. The apparatchiks of the Union survived the long retreat from the burning of Moscow, the establishment of a new government at Perm, the Beria years and all that has followed since. It only stands to reason that they should dominate the new order, whatever it may be, for the Soviet system to survive in all its grey and hallowed tatters. So it is with little surprise that the Premiership is awarded to Frida Vigdorova, poet, journalist, writer and bureaucrat supreme.  \n\nHer speech is quiet and without much fanfare. Despite her attempt to bring vitality to her speech through the reading of poems dedicated to Socialist Realism, her subject matter is in the end unenviably boring. The continuation of the system's key component, including its bureaucrats, mild reforms meant to preserve the essence of the Union while allowing for some degree of democratic sentiment to keep it vital, the outphasing of the NKVD (many dryly note that the word 'removal' has itself been sanitized from the Premier's vocabulary) and the slow transition to a system which can keep the people aligned with Socialism while having its ears to the masses.  \n\nVigdorova moves on to the Unification of Russia, which must be accomplished by the development of economic unity. Here she brightens up, for it is here that she comes into her own: while the Perm government may not wield significant military power, the numbers crunched by the Ministry of Economics indicate that the Central Russian Economic Region, if fully integrated, might provide the resources to increase standards of living significantly under a mixed economic structure. And if that works, well, momentum is a powerful thing… The crowd perks their ears to hear. For once, a Soviet leader is promising unification without bloodshed, without exhaustion, without brother wars. It's a wild gamble, but bureaucrats are always gamblers at heart.  \n\nAnd Vigdorova is now planning the biggest gamble of all."

The man had once been in a Seminary, after all; and Russian history was littered with tyrants whose faith had not leavened their power with mercy. Perhaps it would be fitting to offer prayers to God, even with the history curled thick as blood around the little grave-marker. In the end it was decided that prayers would be irrelevant. Wherever the man was now, he was beyond prayer or shame.  \n\nIn the morning they set off, the four of them - the Politburo had demanded of the Red Army only that they send a token force, to confirm the burial (and to lay rumours of its falsehood to rest). Ivanov rode in the front of the little convoy, his eyes always fixed on the next hill, the next marker. Aleksandr rode with him, guns pointed eastward. Silent and old as the ruins they passed, he sometimes trembled with the weight of his years. The darkness of the war, it was whispered, haunted him still. Pyotr and Lev rode in the back, wide-eyed country boys lapping up the scenery around them.  \n\nA couple of months' journey to get to the forlorn little town that surrounded them, perched on the edge of the Pacific in a town neither Siberian nor occupied. Benign neglect had been gentle in its touch, but the signs were unmistakable: most had left for warmer and more prosperous climes or the cities, and the little pockets of warmth left had grown huddled and insular. The locals called it Okhotsk in their thick accents. The ruins of what had once been a villa were on a nearby hill, the foliage covering the brickworks like a boisterous child.  \n\nThe four made sure to scout the villa before entering, but the effort was unnecessary. The place was long-abandoned save for a carefully cleared-out patch of earth just south of the crumbled-in complex. In the ruins they found a badge, plain and tarnished - a vase of flowers, long-wilted. Alexsandr looked on for a long moment, eyes carefully blank, face set, and then he turned and called the squad to move back to the main town. The pain had long faded from that old place.

The most bitter of hatreds had seeped away, and so the guard's main preoccupation was clearing away the handiwork of careless, excitable children. No one had ever considered the guard someone to worry about at all. It was simply that the Founder had slipped so far into obscurity that dredging him back out was not worth the effort.  \n\nSome nights the guard slept fitful dreams, mostly revolving around food. Manchurian hot-pot, pork and blood sausage soup, the sweet savour of sashima - he hugged himself and shuddered. The old feasts and banquets were long banished, and the splendor of the old imperial robes a distant, fading whisper, but at least one had the memories of food to keep one's wits about himself. He awoke in a gentler mood than usual those nights, and occasionally he would come down into town the following mornings and buy the homeless children a treat from his small purse.  \n\nOther nights - the guard didn't like thinking about those other nights. On those nights the dreams were clear and incisive and utterly nightmarish. The long, long trek northwards from burning Changchun. The yells of ideological officers. And the panic growing ever brighter in flames that licked at the sky itself, the People's Liberation and Red Armies all tumbling down atop themselves in carnage and petty betrayals, until only the Guard was left to stumble into the villa he had made his home. Those dreams were hard to bear, and even harder to wake from.  \n\nOne morning a group of four men bearing the symbol of the old Union - long dead to the Guard - came to the grave of the Founder. He watched warily from the bushes, his decrepit Arisaka rifle in hand, until they were gone. Whoever these people were, they had not been in Manchuria and never known the Founder. Oh, Aisin-Goro Puyi was a socialist, all right - but one without a cause, or a nation, or anything at all except one last, thankless job. And the duty was all he had."

twrecon.0.d:0 "In TWR, every nation is assigned a 'GDP', a measure of economic size, which is based on a formula accounting for a country's civilian and military factories and resources. This is in arbitrary units, to avoid issues of currency conversions and such.\n\nTo view the GDP of the countries around the world, visit the world GDP menu, which can be accessed by clicking the button in the bottom right corner (in the red box in the picture below)."

The permanent members of the security council can then vote for or against the resolution, or abstain, with any vote against being counted as a 'veto' and the resolution not being passed.\n\nWhenever a new resolution is brought to the UN, the menu will be opened automatically, but it can be viewed at any time."

To produce a Nuke, you need to do Nuclear Research, produce enough Fissile Material and assemble the bomb, finishing off by clicking the central button, and you will gain a nuke. Finally, to launch a Nuke you will need to have finished the third nuclear tech."
