 father_of_finnish_artillery_desc:0 "Vilho Nenonen, a veteran of Russian officer schools, served Finland throughout all its wars as an artillery general. He developed artillery trajection calculations and battery formations, that allowed the Finnish army to wield never-seen-before huge concentrated barrages."

 FIN_elections_1952:0 "Presidential Elections of 1952"
 FIN_elections_1952_desc:0 "Election season is upon us! The Finnish people will decide who is to lead their country into the fifth decade of the twentieth century. The choices are between the social democrats, the agrarians, the fascists, and the liberals. Which party will come out on top?"
 FIN_elections_susitaival_victory:0 "Susitaival & the Fascists"
 FIN_elections_susitaival_victory_desc:0 "The Finnish Fascist Party has won the 1952 general election, bringing the country into a shade of reaction and pro-German sentiment. Through a commitment to the country's Lutheran values, they promise to restore the greatness of Finland."
 FIN_elections_paasikivi_victory:0 "Paasikivi's National Coalition"

 FIN_karelian_question:0 "Karelian Policy"
 FIN_karelian_question_desc:0 "The collapse of the Soviet Union has placed the region of Karelia back into our rightful control, but there are many questions that are left to be unanswered. What character will our rule of Karelia assume?"
 FIN_stop_deportations:0 "Stop Deportation"
 FIN_stop_deportations_desc:0 "Until now, we have been exercising a program of deportation for the Russian residents of Karelia, but this must end now. It is immoral and it undermines our mission in the region."
 FIN_grants_to_valpo:0 "ValPo Grants"
 FIN_grants_to_valpo_desc:0 "Valtiollinen Poliisi - The Government Police is in charge of intelligence, and detaining individuals of suspicious, 'unfinnish' backgrounds. We can increase the funding and privileges of ValPo to extend our power and help remove undesirables."
 FIN_finnicization:0 "Finnicization"
 FIN_finnicization_desc:0 "Instead of beating the Russian over the head with Finnish language and culture, we can slowly assimilate them into our ways. Place names in Karelia will be changed from Russian to Finnish, the schools will teach Finnish literature, and the Russians will be given a path to full Finnish citizenship."
 FIN_ryssat_toihin:0 "Ryssät Töihin!"
 FIN_ryssat_toihin_desc:0 "The Russians are occupiers on rightful Finnish land, and they must be punished for that. We will make the Russians help us in the development of the Karelia region by constructing infrastructure. Only through these means can the Russians in Karelia prove themselves to be loyal to the Finnish state."
 FIN_deport_the_rest:0 "Finish Deportations"
 FIN_deport_the_rest_desc:0 "The region of Karelia is in general sparsely populated, but there are still Russians who are inhabiting the region illegally. In order to continue the execution of our Karelian policy, we must finish the last round of deportations to the rump Soviet Union. This will leave the land open to Finnish settlers."
 FIN_karelian_lords:0 "A Karelian Finnish Elite"
 FIN_karelian_lords_desc:0 "Karelia is, and has always been, true Finnish territory. To pretend otherwise would be a betrayal of the Finnish nation. We should integrate the region as quickly as we can, which includes granting a new Finnish elite control over its land and resources."
 FIN_finnish_settlement:0 "Fund Finnish Settlements"
 FIN_finnish_settlement_desc:0 "In order to fully bring Karelia into our national fold, the region must be populated by Finnish people. Unfortunately, it is quite difficult for our citizens to move to Karelia, due to its unfavorable climate. We can lessen their burden by officially backing them"
 FIN_karelian_autonomy:0 "Karelian Autonomy"
 FIN_karelian_autonomy_desc:0 "In order to bring Karelian into the fold, we have to recognize the reality of the region. We cannot integrate Karelia immediately, for that would raise tension to an unnecessary level. Instead, we should grant the region autonomy, and slowly bring them into our national reality."
 FIN_infra_project_karelia:0 "Äänislinna-Käkisalmi Railway"
 FIN_infra_project_karelia_desc:0 "The region of Karelia is greatly underdeveloped when compared to other parts of Finland. This drives down immigration numbers and undermines our national interests there. To remedy this, we will bankroll a railway connecting southern Karelia, going from Aanislinna to Kakisalmi."

 FIN_clog_the_drain_desc:0 "The region of Karelia and its process of development have proven to be a massive financial sink for us. As of right now, we simply cannot support any more national projects there. We will freeze all assets that are inbound for Karelia."

 FIN_new_age_of_national_romanticism_desc:0 "There was once a time when the wildlands of the east inspired the hearts of our poets and artists.

 FIN_self_reliance:0 "Self Reliance"
 FIN_self_reliance_desc:0 "A nation can only rely on the power of its own people to ensure development and progress. We will look to neither the Germans nor the Americans for the source of our national motion, instead, we will look to the hearts and minds of the Finnish people themselves."
 FIN_unite_the_people:0 "Unite The People.."
 FIN_unite_the_people_desc:0 "Finland cannot move forward if it finds its own people moving and looking around every which way. If we are to ensure a prosperous future for Finland the people must stand as one collective entity."
 FIN_the_bible_and_the_law:0 "The Bible and The Lawbook"
 FIN_the_bible_and_the_law_desc:0 "The two things which have guided the people of Finland into the light are the practices of Lutheran religion and the all-encompassing systems of law. We ought to remember them if we are to proceed in unity and self-reliance."
 FIN_around_kekkonen:0 "...Around The President"
 FIN_around_kekkonen_desc:0 "Urho Kekkonen is the platonic ideal of the new Finland. He is the avatar of self-reliance, unity, and beauty, and all Finns must be rallied around his cause and his ideals. Long live Kekkonen! Long live the earth of Finland!"
 FIN_liberation_policy:0 "Policy of Liberation"
 FIN_liberation_policy_desc:0 "The Estonians are our linguistic and cultural siblings, but they currently suffer under the yoke of German oppression. We must campaign globally for their liberation from the Nazi empire, and for their unifacation with us."
 FIN_finladsierung:0 "Finlandsierung"
 FIN_finladsierung_desc:0 "As of now, we are simply an obstacle in the way of the German domination of Europe. We are in no place to sideline them or seriously oppose them in their foreign policy efforts, and the sooner we recognize that, the better it is for us."

 FIN_ask_for_surplus_equipment:0 "Request Surplus German Equipment"
 FIN_ask_for_surplus_equipment_desc:0 "Our armed forces stand lacking in the basic materials of war-making. Luckily, our new German friends can help us out on this front."
 FIN_scrap_swedish:0 "Scrap Swedish"
 FIN_scrap_swedish_desc:0 "The Swedish minority in our country has proven time and time again that they are more interested in fulfilling the interests of foreigners than they are in aiding the development of the Finnish nation. They do not deserve our formal recognition or respect, and as such, the Swedish language will be banned from every inch of Finnish soil."
 FIN_respect_the_military:0 "Respect our Veterans"
 FIN_respect_the_military_desc:0 "The men who have fought valiantly for the existence of our country are our greatest elements. We should seek to aid them wherever possible."
 FIN_denounce_democracy:0 "Denounce Democracy"
 FIN_denounce_democracy_desc:0 "The ballot box is a channel for decadence and national degradation. It has brought countless nations to ruin and effemencance, and it must no longer hold any sway in the land of the Finns! Death to democracy!"
 FIN_militaristic_summer_camps:0 "Military Scout Summer Camps"
 FIN_militaristic_summer_camps_desc:0 "If we are to truly rejuvenate the spirit of our nation, we must bring the values of fascism to the children of Finland. Our government will sponsor the establishment of military summer camps for our young boys, educating them in the martial and national arts of Finland."
 FIN_ties_to_the_germans:0 "Reinforce German Ties"
 FIN_ties_to_the_germans_desc:0 "Berlin is the Mecca of facist thought and action today. The German programme of national rejuvenation is nothing short of spectacular, and a model for us here in Finland. It is in our interests to further align ourselves with Germany."
 FIN_lutheran_nation:0 "Finland is Lutheran"
 FIN_lutheran_nation_desc:0 "The Lutheran religion of the Finnish people has been a source of great national and cultural unity over the centuries. We must reaffirm our connections to the Lutheran Church, and make it clear that no other faith is proper for the Finnish man or the Finnish woman."
 FIN_helsinki_nights:0 "Night of the Cudgels"
 FIN_helsinki_nights_desc:0 "There are many people in our country who would like to see our government crash and burn horribly. These people present a great threat to the existence of our government, but if we are willing, there is something we can do about it."
 attempt_to_overthrow_the_pariliament_tt:0 "§RThe fascists will attempt to overthrow the government!§!\n"
 FIN_realpolitik:0 "Realpolitik"
 FIN_realpolitik_desc:0 "The world we have today is certainly not favourable to the idealists among us. Everywhere we look, cutthroats and fascists stand tall above Finland, like a cloud blocking the light of the sun. However, we would only send our people to ruin if we were to refuse relations with the Germans and Italians, so we have to play this intelligently."
 FIN_affirm_german_relations:0 "Affirm German Relations"
 FIN_affirm_german_relations_desc:0 "As Europe's reigning hegemon, Germany exerts a great deal of influence over the affairs of our country. If we are to continue with our programme of Realpolitik, it is in our interests to sit down with the Germans and reassure them of our bilateral relations."
 FIN_peace_vigilance_neutrality:0 "Peace, Vigilance, Neutrality"
 FIN_peace_vigilance_neutrality_desc:0 "While the rest of the continent tears itself apart in strife, both physical and political, Finland stands tall in its peace. This can raise our prestige amongst our fellow nations."
 FIN_state_visit_italy:0 "State Visit to Italy"
 FIN_state_visit_italy_desc:0 "If we are to coexist with the facist nations of Europe, we must show them that we are truly amiable. We ought to arrange a state visit to Italy in the near future, to fortify the ties between our two countries."
 FIN_mutual_assistance_treaty:0 "Mutual Assistance Agreement"
 FIN_mutual_assistance_treaty_desc:0 "No country should ever stand alone, even if that means standing with those whom they have no particular good feelings towards. We are willing to aid the Germans in their national development, so long as they are willing to aid us in ours."
 FIN_neutrality_or_else:0 "Finnish Neutrality"
 FIN_neutrality_or_else_desc:0 "Neither Washington nor Berlin has the answers to our national questions. The only city which can offer such a thing is Helsinki. The new Finland will stand above the geo-political squabbles of the world."
 FIN_decriminalise_communism:0 "Decriminalise Communism"
 FIN_decriminalise_communism_desc:0 "If we are truly committed to the development of both democracy and socialism in Finland, the Finnish Communist Party must be free to run its operations just like any other political party. Anything less would be a monumental hypocrisy."
 FIN_open_up_to_the_west:0 "Open Up to the West"
 FIN_open_up_to_the_west_desc:0 "The nations of the Toronto Accord are the final bastions of democracy in a world ill with Nazi fascism and autoritarainism. We should do everything in our power to align Finland towards them, if we wish to fulfill the national democratic project."
 FIN_sisters_alone:0 "Sisters, Alone"
 FIN_sisters_alone_desc:0 "Apart from us, Sweden is the last true democracy left in the region of Scandinavia. We must stick to them at all costs, lest we both fall to the Nazi encirlement."
 FIN_nordic_defence_treaty:0 "Nordic Defence Treaty"
 FIN_nordic_defence_treaty_desc:0 "Although we do not have the facilities for a great amount of power projection, we can surely speak to our regional neighbours. The Nordic countries will be united in arms through the Nordic Defense Treaty, for the good of democracy and freedom."
 FIN_unity_from_liberty:0 "Unity through Liberty"
 FIN_unity_from_liberty_desc:0 "There is nothing more unifying the spirit of debate, democracy, and liberty. Although the Finnish people possess a great variety of political ideas, they can all see their realization through the ballot box."
 FIN_trade_with_the_world:0 "Trade With the World"
 FIN_trade_with_the_world_desc:0 "Our people possess a great variety of productive skills, and we hold a great amount of goods to trade with the rest of the globe. It only makes sense for us to open our market up to foreigners."
 FIN_nationalism_and_democracy:0 "Nationalism and Democracy"
 FIN_nationalism_and_democracy_desc:0 "The two things which have defined us more than anything else are our traditions and our political systems. Finns must take pride in the fact that they are Finns, and that they get to choose who rules over their affairs."
 FIN_seek_american_help:0 "Seek Toronto Assistance"
 FIN_seek_american_help_desc:0 "In order to fully integrate Finland into the Western order, we must go to the Toronto Accord directly for aid. Who knows, maybe they'll even let us be a member."
 FIN_declare_greater_finland:0 "Proclaim Greater Finland"
 FIN_declare_greater_finland_desc:0 "Now that we have consolidated our control of the Finnish state, we can now move onto our goals of true national rejuvenation. All of Finland's rightful land will belong to Finland!"
 FIN_defense_forces_intervention:0 "Defence Forces Intervene"
 FIN_defense_forces_intervention_desc:0 "The fascists have been overthrown! Seeing the existential threat they posed to Finnish democracy, the Finnish armed forces stepped in and removed the party from power. Only time will tell what lies in Finland's future."
 FIN_martial_law:0 "Martial Law"
 FIN_martial_law_desc:0 "Since the civilian government has been dissolved, the maintenance of law and order lies in the hands of the army. This decision will likely be unpopular, but it is necessary for us to move forward."
 FIN_failure_of_the_coup:0 "Danger is Over"
 FIN_failure_of_the_coup_desc:0 "We have excised any lingering fascist influence present in the Finnish state. Now is the time to decide whether to allow the formation of a democratic civilian government or continue our rule over Finland."
 FIN_restore_democracy:0 "Restore Democracy"
 FIN_restore_democracy_desc:0 "Finland can wake up from the fascist nightmare. If the armed forces were to stay in power, it would simply create a new oppression for the Finnish people. We can see the light now."
 FIN_military_government:0 "Military Government"
 FIN_military_government_desc:0 "The safety of Finnish democracy cannot be guaranteed yet. In order to provide true national protection, the military will remain in power."
 FIN_forcible_removal:0 "Forcible Removal of Opposition"
 FIN_forcible_removal_desc:0 "In order to truly govern the new, greater Finland, we must have no obstacles in our path, be they internal or external. All dissident political elements will be purged from our great country."
 FIN_centralize_power:0 "Centralize Power"
 FIN_centralize_power_desc:0 "The Finnish nation is the Finnish state! If we are to truly realize our national project, all power must be kept among our hands, and no one else's."
 FIN_betray_jews:0 "Betray the Jews"
 FIN_betray_jews_desc:0 "Finland has been unique in Europe for her ambivalence towards the Jewish Question, but those days are over. Finland is a country for the Lutheran man and the Lutheran man alone. We will send our Jewish population to Germany."
 FIN_corporatism:0 "Corporatism"
 FIN_corporatism_desc:0 "Our national corporations are an extension of our national spirit. It is only  reasonable that we base our economic policy on a symbiotic relationship between the corporations and the state."
 FIN_announce_ambitions:0 "Announce Further Ambitions"
 FIN_announce_ambitions_desc:0 "The realization of greater Finland will be a titanic effort. All nations must be made aware of our drive to see it through, lest they consider us weak and effeminate."
 FIN_prepare_liberation:0 "Prepare for Conflict"
 FIN_prepare_liberation_desc:0 "The road to national rejuvenation will give us a great deal of enemies. We must prepare to defend ourselves from foreign aggression if we seek to go down this path."
 FIN_march_into_sweden:0 "Liberate Meänmaa"
 FIN_march_into_sweden_desc:0 "Our former oppressors in Sweden currently hold the rightfully Finnish territory of Meanmaa. We must struggle for its liberation and return to their true Finnish brethren!"
 FIN_fight_like_the_athenians:0 "Fight like Athenians"
 FIN_fight_like_the_athenians_desc:0 "Every Finnish man must have Finland in his heart, and every Finnish man must be willing to go to war for her. We will defend our country to the death of our nation, if need be."
 FIN_play_it_safe:0 "Play it Safe"
 FIN_play_it_safe_desc:0 "Finland once thought it could outplay the encroaching Soviets - we did, but at the cost of trading one enemy for another. The German alliance has grown swollen with military might, and our borders are always vulnerable. We must tread carefully - always with the hope that our diplomatic ties will open a path to a brighter future, but never without the knowledge of how fragile that hope is."
 FIN_discontent:0 "Discontent"
 FIN_discontent_desc:0 "Finland has always faced existential threats, whether they came from Moscow, Oslo or Berlin, and we have always prevailed over the enemy. The German menace has shown its true, horrifying colors to the whole world - how can we turn away in the face of evil? We will take a stance against the National Socialists - and, God Willing, we will prevail once again."
 FIN_approach_old_enemies:0 "Approach an Old Enemy"
 FIN_approach_old_enemies_desc:0 "We have many reasons to dislike the Soviets: mutually opposed claims on Karelia, ideology and a history of conflict. In these troubled times, however, unprecedented measures are necessary to secure our flanks - we will open a formal diplomatic channel to Perm, negotiating military defense matters and offering a diplomatic thaw in exchange. If this goes well, when the war with the Reich comes we will not have to stand alone."
 FIN_kekkonens_coup:0 "Abolish Elections"
 FIN_kekkonens_coup_desc:0 "Urho Kekkonen has had enough of this democratic process - it is nothing but a cauldron for squabbling ambitions and so-called "policy-making" by his inferiors! The workings of lesser democrats scribble themselves onto bills which are worth less with every passing day, as public protest grows against an impotent and self-crippled government. Kekkonen has a solemn duty to end this farce, and he will carry it out. To serve the people, he will have to assume power in their name - and destroy those who stand against him, no matter the cost."
 FIN_ministry_reorganization:0 "Ministry Reorganization"
 FIN_ministry_reorganization_desc:0 "Our Ministry of Defense is the key to developing an effective defence against the threat to our south. However, our tactical innovation, our officer corps, and our combat-ready units have stagnated since the Continuation War with the Soviets, and the gap is only growing bigger by the year. It is now a strategic imperative that we conduct a top-down shakedown of the Ministry to force out the outdated dogmas and rebuild a defence strategy from the bottom up."
 FIN_commitment_total_defense:0 "Commit to Total Defense"
 FIN_commitment_total_defense_desc:0 "Our most pressing problem in the realm of national defense is one of segmentation: Finland is divided into military provinces, with each province responsible for fielding militias in the event of an invasion. While this might work for mass invasions comprising standard infantry forces, it is unlikely to work for nuclear-armed opponents wielding complex forces. We must come up with something better - and that something is Total Defence, which wields our economy, armed forces and political system into a single responsive instrument."
 FIN_deep_defense:0 "Deep Defense"
 FIN_deep_defense_desc:0 "The cornerstone of our defensive policy is using terrain to our advantage: as we drew the Russians into the mountains and plateaus, they became easy prey for asymmetrical assaults and supply-attritional warfare. We will reinvent this policy in the form of Deep Defense, which prioritises manpower and operational control over space - pulling back when it is convenient and striking when the enemy is overstretched."
 FIN_moukari_line:0 "Moukari Line"
 FIN_moukari_line_desc:0 "The key to our defensive strategy is to develop our mass-fortification strategy along specific territorial lines. As the famed Sledgehammer Policy goes, a combination of artillery fire, fortification-based defense, and heavy airpower will give our forces a massive advantage in battle - we will make the enemy pay for every inch of ground they take as they walk into the gunfire!"
 FIN_every_man_serves:0 "Every Man Serves"
 FIN_every_man_serves_desc:0 "As a final precaution, we will introduce mandatory conscription for the Finnish Armed Forces - every man of age shall be trained in the arts of handling a rifle, defensive doctrine infantry maneuvers and technical-support roles. They may not be professional, and if push comes to shove their weapons might be subpar, but they will be more than sufficient for a viable mass-defense strategy."
 FIN_mark_finnish_lands:0 "Mark our Land"
 FIN_mark_finnish_lands_desc:0 "A clear delineation of territory between Russia and Finland can only be to our mutual interests, for our common enemy will only benefit from our disunity. We will call for mutual recognition of territorial claims on either side of our borders, ending once and for all this source of discord, and lower our troop garrisons on the border to boot. This should give us greater leverage in manipulating our mutual enemies, and clear the path for larger-scale cooperation in the future."
 FIN_the_white_pact:0 "The White Pact"
 FIN_the_white_pact_desc:0 "The Soviets are, in truth, not our pressing threat - it has been a long time since the Continuation War, and there are far greater things to fight about than Karelia. To secure our mutual interests against the German Menace, we will formally declare our friendship on the global stage through the signing of a treaty of Mutual Friendship. Diplomatic channels, limited military technology exchanges and the opening of small markets to each other will set the stage for formal military cooperation, to be used to savage effect at the proper time."
 FIN_freedom_for_estonia:0 "Freedom for Estonia"
 FIN_freedom_for_estonia_desc:0 "The Estonian problem has long been a thorn in our side; instability in our refugee-provinces has made economic development essentially impossible, not to mention the security issues it has brought up for our forces. This Gordian Knot must be cut, regardless of the cost, and as the RK Ostland trembles a blade emerges from the depths. We will sponsor the arming and repatriation of our Estonian minority population to their homeland, where they will build a future for themselves - and far away from us."
 FIN_avenge_our_forefathers:0 "Avenge our Forefathers"
 FIN_avenge_our_forefathers_desc:0 "The old stain of our collaboration with Fascism colors us still - we cannot escape it, nor can we hope to be liberated from its influence, unless we take action to fully redeem ourselves. Our ancestors fought St. Petersburg and Oslo - we will fight off the latest generation of oppressors no matter the cost, and like the rest before them we will triumph over them all!"
 FIN_reorganize_leadership:0 "Reorganize Military Leadership"
 FIN_reorganize_leadership_desc:0 "We are looking at an unparalleled threat, and so we must approach it in unparalleled ways. Our generals are hidebound, tied to the sinking stone of old tradition and older protocol - it would be best for us to cut ourselves loose. Quiet mass retirements of these generals will begin a wholesale reinvention of the Finnish military establishment, as Kekkonen invites new and promising staff to rebuild our defensive strategy wholesale. Is it not true, after all, that the young are more extreme than the old?"
 FIN_new_tricks:0 "Kekkonen's New Tricks"
 FIN_new_tricks_desc:0 "As it turns out, the adoption of dictatorship comes with a few handy perks! Kekkonen's agenda can now be pursued in a truly unfettered fashion, without the worries of a Parliament or military establishment whose discontent could topple mere democrats - and this grants us a certain degree of leverage when negotiating with foreign powers. The wholesale use of force, after all, is nothing to be sniffed at, especially when the party who is wielding the gun has no election to lose."
 FIN_protector_of:0 "Protector of Finland"
 FIN_protector_of_desc:0 "Every good autocracy needs a little cult of personality to keep it going - it can be likened to a barrel of industrial oil poured into the gears of the political machine, and if the rhetoric is a little bombastic, well, that is the point, is it not? We will do the same and have Kekkonen associate himself with Mannerheim, the greatest Finn of the century. Just as Mannerheim served his country without malice or fear, so too shall Kekkonen's valor and courage lead us ever onwards into the future!"
 FIN_protest_nazis:0 "Protest the Nazi"
 FIN_protest_nazis_desc:0 "Protest the Nazi"
 FIN_open_to_the_west:0 "Open up to the West"
 FIN_open_to_the_west_desc:0 "Now that we have officially abandoned our neutrality, it is time to take the next logical step: to protect against German invasion, we will open formal talks with Sweden, Switzerland and the Toronto Accord's diplomatic members, discussing matters of free trade and diplomatic ties. What this really means, of course, is that we need the Americans and British to promise to defend us should the Germans choose to invade, but we will never say that to Germania's face. Well, not directly, at least."
 FIN_coordination_with_sweden:0 "Coordinate with Sweden"
 FIN_coordination_with_sweden_desc:0 "Sweden has not always been our ally or friend, but they share our strategic concerns and a common insecurity regarding our mutual neighbour to the south. Formal diplomatic requests to coordinate our defense arrangements will ensure that should either of us suffer invasion, the other will come to their aid. This is likely to irritate Germany even more than we already have, of course, but - as the British say - in for a penny, in for a pound."
 FIN_berlin_card:0 "Berlin Card"
 FIN_berlin_card_desc:0 "It is the duty of the President to safeguard the nation against the Fascist threat, and in these uncertain times Urho Kekkonen is the only man who can do the job. Only Kekkonen's credentials with senior circles in Germania will keep the armies from Helsinki, and only his opponents' fear of him keeps Finland above the chaos that Europe descends into day upon day. At least, that is what we will tell the press: the Berlin Card that Kekkonen wields will prove a powerful tool in cowing domestic opposition and foreign adversaries alike."
 FIN_join_german_faction:0 "Join the German Faction"
 FIN_join_german_faction_desc:0 "We have long attempted to delay the inevitable, and we have fought as noble a fight as any country in our position could possibly claim. Alas, we can no longer deny German pressure - we will counter it by proposing a treaty of Friendship and Amity with Germany, formally joining the Reich's continental defense arrangements as an autonomous state. This does not represent a blank cheque of German intervention in foreign affairs, however, and the President has made it very clear to Germania that Finland will not tolerate any attempts to suborn our sovereignty."
 FIN_joint_exercises:0 "Joint Exercises"
 FIN_joint_exercises_desc:0 "The Germans are here to stay, at least for the short run: we can no longer run away from reality. Even so, the Paasikivi-Kekkonen doctrine gives us an avenue of escape: in the last years of our predecessor's regime armed joint exercises were used to keep the illusion of military parity and diplomatic amity with the Germans.

National Survey teams have visited various sites and identified several locations for viable chromium extraction, to offset the new spending that is straining the economy, chromium extraction can be used to generate a large income and raise capital for the several endeavours in the region and also several other undertakings in the country."

To partially offset the lack of technical expertise, foreign technical firms, experts and contractors have been hired, though a suitable interim solution it is unfeasible and unsustainable in the long run, in view of this the Parliament has released a massive grant to the Helsinki University of Technology to expand and improve its facilities and the campus as a whole, to lead the way of a new and more technically developed Finland."

Several top metalworking firms have been reviewed from the heavy industries in the Steel belt in the USA to the massive concentration of the goliath industrial complexes in Rhineland of Germany, even the "closed cities" of the fallen Soviet Union have been studied, all have been studied extensively by our engineering Experts who have developed plans and designs for amalgamating all their features and applying them to build up the Heavy industries in Finland."

Though we have built a massive industrial tower, it still stands on soft snow, careful policy making and ensuring that too much exposure to the global economy does not happen, as the local nascent industries need to foster more until they can become strong enough to enter the hyper competitive global market without any fear, and also possibly dominate it, some of the Finns at the Nokia Oyj have some ideas on "dominating" the market."

Yet unlike in most fable stories the man did not come alone, for even with his position usurped he still has many friend with him now and in the distance. Alas he is able to offer us much and we are able to ask much more for in return. With the foundation of our relationship so amicable, surely we are able to negotiate a most favorable agreement for the good of Rus of course"

The horrors unleashed by Kuznetsov and his minions showed every man and woman just the dark fate that awaits them under Bolshevism. More importantly however not just the citizens became aware of this but a sizable chunk of the Red Army. Alas in the midst of the night a series of couriers came to the Red Army Generals doors..."

TRV_karelia_desc:0 "The region that is Karelia has been for centuries been subject of much food and spilled blood between the dogged Finnish State, us and even the Swedes with the finns. With the former treacherously seizing the whole area in the wake of our great defeat. Now that Russia is reborn from the weakness of the defeat and the cancer of Bolshevism, the finns tremble in fear once more at the prospect of being mauled by the russian bear. As such all we have to do is ask kindly for what is ours and should they refuse we shall paint the snow of Murmansk red with their blood!"

Yet we bear them no ill will, for only months ago we were similarly lost like they are now, facing a nigh invincible enemy all alone in the cold.

All of our general staff of course has heard the rumors, human beings being shredded and broken down to be put into tin cans in the shadow of the night, to then be eaten by the unsuspecting populace. Whilst perhaps somewhat exaggerated, our intelligence service has at least confirmed some of it true and as such falling to our blade will be mercy really..."
TRV_buryatia:0 "Siberia's Own Personal Nightmare"
TRV_buryatia_desc:0 "Before confronting the american puppets, there lies one last rat in our way. Despite its small size it is gorged and grown fat with tumors and foreign weapons. An abomination even worse than the "Republic", an entire region directly administered by foreign occupiers. It is only natural as such that from this hellscape an ideology perfectly reflecting the twisted souls of its inhabitants has emerged: Anarcho-Fascism. Combining the two most disgusting ideas ever to graze russian soil we are truly blessed to have the means to stamp any memory of this nightmare from the annals of history."
TRV_republic:0 "The Last Foreign Occupier"
TRV_republic_desc:0 "As much as we want to burn any memory of the reds books and ideas, Marx's observation that all of history appears so to say twice, first as tragedy then as farce quite fits the situation. As the two giants of Russia face off for final dominance, the conflict of the civil war is in a twisted way repeated. Military Junta against military junta, the irony is lost on none. They have the backing of the foreigners, we the bulk of the russian people. Our battle will be legendary and at its end we shall mail Vlasov's head straight to the White house!"

But as we make preparations to construct him a grand mausoleum to forever his memory Premier Bulganin has candidly reminded us that the hole he left is quite an enormous one to fill and to find a successor that will not only fill his shoes but also honor and continue his legacy will be quite the challenge..."

TRV_altunin_desc:0 "In the silent chaos and confusion following Marshal Bagramyan's death, his closest follower and protegé, Marshal Alexander Altunin has succeeded his position as provisional benevolent military-dictator of Rus. Promising wide ranging reforms that aim to address the Junta's most pressing issues that blight our administration and economy whilst retaining the spirit and form of his great predecessor, many in our administration sigh in relief that the old man's passing did not leave many lasting damages..."
TRV_eternal_junta:0 "The Eternal Junta"
TRV_eternal_junta_desc:0 "Marshal and now military-dictator Altunin understands that to handle a state broken and twisted by decades of abuse from the Bolsheviks, then sewn together in the fires of war and madness is an alone almost unbearable burden riddled with traps and spaces to slip and as such he has formed an advisory cabinet called "The Eternal Junta". Consisting of our governments most loyal and competent generals, these wise men are sure to aid the Marshal with his burden and bring the motherland back from the brink."
TRV_junta_agriculture:0 "The Junta's Agriculture"
TRV_junta_agriculture_desc:0 "With the scars of Russia reaching chasms in depth and new wounds being wracked upon her body still we recognize that the best path for Russia is one of stability for now. As such we shall extend the guidance and stability the Junta has brought to all areas of political and economic life. The first being the agriculture we shall focus on big farms, modelled similar to the Junta of one benevolent overlord overseeing large seas of green we are sure considerably boost our productivity and return to the glorious model of the free market economy."
TRV_junta_industry:0 "The Junta's Industry"
TRV_junta_industry_desc:0 "Marshal Altunin's plan of extending the guidance and stability the Junta has brought to all areas of political and economic life continues. The second being the gradual but steady total privatization of state owned assets under the stern look of Premier Bulganin and moving once more towards a market economy. Whilst this will mean at first a drop quality of life for our people as many safety nets of the Union are cut back soon we shall surely take part in the prosperity of the first world! Of course we won't just gift these assets away, with select assets being handed to the members of the Junta of course."
TRV_junta_finances:0 "The Junta's Finances"
TRV_junta_finances_desc:0 "The third model we shall introduce being unfortunately the most delicate of the four: the funding necessary to truly revitalize the motherland. As it stands we will need many hundred billions in dollars to hope to one day match the great economies of the world. Alas with a heavy heart we shall turn to an ancient practice amply used by the great conquerors of history: taxing the conquered lands. The irony of doing this to our own people is not lost on us but it is fortunately for the greater good."
TRV_new_russian_army:0 "The New Russian Army"
TRV_new_russian_army_desc:0 "After more than a decade the russian lands stand once more united, united by the firm but benevolent hand of Marshal Bagramyan and Altunin the people rejoice as those two great men will forever be remembered in russian history as the saviors of the motherland from all that sought to destroy it, be it from within or without. \n\nYet neither desired nor desire wordly glory of wealth or grand monuments, their monument shall be the newly reforged Russian Army. Forever loyal to the two Marshals and their vision even when Marshal Altunin is interred beside his mentor they shall march onward to defend the motherland for eternity!"

SPA_servitude_to_the_state_desc:0 "The state is, above all else, the most important entity to Spain's existence.

SPA_open_up_to_the_west_desc:0 "It has become increasingly evident that the balance of power in Europe is woefully stacked against out former acquaintances in Rome and Germania.

SPA_guests_from_washington:0 "Guests from Washington"

SPA_deescalate_spanish_axis_relations:0 "Deescalate Spanish-Axis Relations"
SPA_deescalate_spanish_axis_relations_desc:0 "The relationship between Madrid and Germania had become increasingly strained when the war in Europe broke out.

SPA_ideas_of_an_european_community_desc:0 "The concept of pan-European cooperation in economic matters isn't a new concept, however previous attempts have been unsuccessful due to capitalist and bolshevik robber-barons sabotaging the market for their own benefit.

While it had been left alone for years after the war in Europe ended, its status as an independent nation has been a tricky one. Seeing how the country is awkwardly co-ruled by a Spaniard and a Frenchman, perhaps it would do us some good to finally end this micro-state for the sake of bringing the people of Europe closer together."

#MILITARY#
GEN_New_Arms_Age:0 "New Arms Age"
GEN_New_Arms_Age_desc:0 "We have entered into a new era of unprecedented technological and doctrinal advancement, yet the growth of our armed forces is still hampered by our outdated technology. Thus, to obtain our true strength, we must focus our time and energy on the technological development of our military. There are many ways in which we could accomplish this task, yet our experts suggest studying the advancements in armored warfare and equipment modernization that have been adopted abroad. Through keen utilization of these new developments, we can garner enough strength to win the next inevitable conflict."
GEN_Armored_Advancements:0 "Armored Advancements"
GEN_Armored_Advancements_desc:0 "If these past two world wars have taught us anything, it is that tanks dominate the battlefield. Sadly, our armored technology is pitifully outdated. This is unacceptable, as we must modernize our armored corps if we want to defend our nation against the industrialized powers of the world. Thankfully, we have some solid ideas on how to do this, as we can model our designs based on those created abroad."
GEN_European_Designs:0 "European Designs"
GEN_European_Designs_desc:0 "Today, when you think of tanks, you don't think of America, you think of Germany, and of panzers rolling into Moscow. Despite America's industrial prowess, Europe, and especially Germany, has proven itself to be the true master of armored warfare. Thus, we must focus our efforts on emulating European designs and strategies.  If these efforts turn out to be successful, we shall become a force to be reckoned with."
GEN_Combined_Arms:0 "Combined Arms"
GEN_Combined_Arms_desc:0 "While our strategists have decidedly concluded that mobile capability is crucial to modern warfare, this doesn't necessarily mean we must rely solely on our tank corps. We must ensure that our tanks are directly supported in the field by several different units, especially mobile infantry regiments. Through this varied combination of tanks, planes, trucks, and men the enemy will find themselves quickly overwhelmed; and thus promptly defeated."
GEN_Lighting_War:0 "Lightning War"
GEN_Lighting_War_desc:0 "The European model of mobile warfare is largely based around the German concept of 'Blitzkrieg' or Lightning Warfare. The Reich used this strategy during the second world war, and it delivered nearly impeccable results, especially during the Western campaign. Comprising various operational methods such as 'schwerpunkt,' 'pursuit,' and 'mopping-up,' this strategy intends to capitalize on the sheer speed at which you can deliver a decisive blow to the enemy to cut off and disorganize enemy forces. This is surely a model worth emulating to the best of our ability."
GEN_American_Design:0 "American Designs"
GEN_American_Design_desc:0 "Though the likes of Erwin Rommel may claim otherwise, American tanks deserve more credit. They are strong, sturdy, and reliable beasts of machinery capable of mass production. German doctrine is simply incomparable to American industrial power. It would be very wise for us to base our new tank designs off of American models. These tanks can pose a formidable threat in the field, and may be just what we need to ensure victory."
GEN_Heavy_Steel:0 "Heavy Steel"
GEN_Heavy_Steel_desc:0 "The armor and build quality of these new tanks will come at a cost however. We need to utilize a fair amount of steel in order to produce these tanks, which can prove a challenge to afford. Thus we must open up steel milling facilities and divert further resources toward steelworks. Despite the heavy costs of steel manufacturing, these efforts are likely to yield great results."
GEN_Main_Battle_Tanks:0 "Main Battle Tanks"
GEN_Main_Battle_Tanks_desc:0 "Because of our limited capacity for tank production, we must ensure that the tanks we produce are of the most superior quality. Thus, we should look no further than the example of American main battle tanks, or MBT's for short. These tanks make no compromises, possessing enough armor and firepower to rival a heavy tank and enough speed to outflank a light tank. These MBT designs are perfectly suited to our needs as well as our level of industrial output."
GEN_Modern_Equipment:0 "Modern Equipment"
GEN_Modern_Equipment_desc:0 "A major point of concern for us is the outdated equipment we still utilize in the field. However, we have faith in our newly developing equipment designs. Above all else, we must begin the vital process of modernizing our equipment technology to produce a stronger army. The quicker we can begin this process, the faster we will have our superior equipment supplied to our entire armed forces."
GEN_Great_Power_Designs:0 "Great Power Designs"
GEN_Great_Power_Designs_desc:0 "Despite our nation's long history and determined spirit, we have never been able to be up to par with the great powers of the world. However, through studying their advancements we believe we can change this. It is crucial we adopt their designs, as we do not have the time nor the resources to spare in order to develop these technologies on our own. We may not be a great power, but so long as we can keep up with them, we can put up a good fight."
GEN_Lessons_Of_World_Wars:0 "Lessons Of World Wars"
GEN_Lessons_Of_World_Wars_desc:0 "These past two wars have brought to the people of the world an unprecedented level of misery and destruction. Yet, these conflicts have also taught us many vital lessons. Through studying historical developments, doctrine, and technology we can learn to apply these lessons to improve the current state of our army. Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it."
GEN_Military_Academy:0 "Military Acedemy"
GEN_Military_Academy_desc:0 "Though it is important for our high command to learn and adapt to our new developments and tactics, it is equally important for us to teach these lessons to our new officers. Opening up new military academies, as well as improving existing facilities will allow us a new space to educate our bright, young military students. Additionally, we must reform our curriculum to fit our new, modern standards. New blood and new knowledge are exactly what our army needs."
GEN_Develop_Equipment:0 "Develop Equipment"
GEN_Develop_Equipment_desc:0 "We have experienced some exciting breakthroughs in our research programs. Now that we have discovered these new ideas and equipment designs through our research programs, it is time for us to turn these blueprints of ours into real, usable equipment in the field. Through focusing more effort and money toward development initiatives we believe we will soon be able to produce this technology. It is the next step in establishing our military as a more modern and capable force."
GEN_Standard_Formations:0 "Standard Formations"
GEN_Standard_Formations_desc:0 "Despite our rapid technological advancement, we have neglected our drilling practices. Our men are clumsy, and lacking discipline both in training and in the field. Guns are important, but how can we expect our men to carry guns if they can't even handle themselves? We believe we can solve these problems by implementing standard drilling formations at our boot camps."
GEN_Special_Forces:0 "Special Forces"
GEN_Special_Forces_desc:0 "The reorganization of our armed forces, combined with strenuous modernization efforts, has led to our newfound ability to form specialized, highly trained units to serve alongside our standard forces. These men are better suited to fight under certain conditions, undergoing intense training practices and establishing themselves as our army's most elite soldiers. Our experts believe these units could be the key to winning future wars. We must see what can become of this interesting opportunity."
GEN_Reform_Military_Structure:0 "Reform Military Structure"
GEN_Reform_Military_Structure_desc:0 "One of our major issues is the terrible organizational structure of our army. We must ensure that our army is organized in such a manner as to suit our new doctrinal advancements as well as to prevent an imbalance of strength between our enlisted men, officer corps, and high command. Reestablishing our military as both highly organized and tightly regulated from the top down will limit corruption and allow orders to be more properly followed and enforced. It is a necessary task, as if we lack proper structure, our army may very well prove to be incompetent during wartime."
#AIRFORCE#
GEN_Aviation_Efforts:0 "Aviation Efforts"
GEN_Aviation_Efforts_desc:0 "Recent wars, in Europe and in Asia and the Pacific, have shown the importance of air power in modern warfare. Great powers have utilised air forces to turn the tide of battle on the ground, seas or achieve strategic goals. We should focus on aviation to make sure we keep up in this arena."
GEN_Air_Force_Development:0 "Airforce Development"
GEN_Air_Force_Development_desc:0 "It is imperative that we develop and modernise our air forces to make them more effective in keeping control of the skies. Both the equipment and aircraft themselves, along with doctrine and strategy, must be modernised and kept up to date."
GEN_Experimental_Helicopters:0 "Experimental Helicopters"
GEN_Experimental_Helicopters_desc:0 "Helicopters are a relatively new technology, but one with great potential. Able to take off and land vertically, helicopters have the ability to bring troops and supplies to and from the frontline rapidly and without the need for air strips, as well as provide reconnaissance and ground support. We should certainly look into this technology."
GEN_Air_To_Ground:0 "Air To Ground"
GEN_Air_To_Ground_desc:0 "One of the key uses of air power is to support ground forces. The Germans have shown the use of this, with their use of concentrated close air support as part of their 'blitzkrieg' campaigns across Europe. We should emulate this success by developing strategies and equipment for close air support."
GEN_Jet_Age:0 "Jet Age"
GEN_Jet_Age_desc:0 "Propellor-drive planes defined the wars of the 1940s, but now we have entered the jet age, with jet engines allowing far higher performance from military aircraft. The major powers have already developed a wide range of jet aircraft, and we should certainly keep up by investing in researching and producing our own."
GEN_Air_School:0 "Air School"
GEN_Air_School_desc:0 "Equipment is one thing, but an air force needs trained personnel. We should concentrate on creating schools to train new pilots and theorists to be the next generation of air force personnel for our nation."
GEN_Air_Doctrine:0 "Air Doctrine"
GEN_Air_Doctrine_desc:0 "Just as important as the quality of aircraft is the way that they are used. Various air doctrines exist, whether it is focusing on air superiority, close air support or strategic bombing. We should decide on a strategy that fits our position best, and work to refine it to make our air force as consistently effective as possible."
GEN_Jet_Bomber:0 "Jet Bomber"
GEN_Jet_Bomber_desc:0 "No country has shown the value of strategic bombing more than the United States in their war in the Pacific. With new jet technology, ever larger bombers can fly higher, further and carry larger payloads to their targets. While we cannot match the productive capacity of America, producing a squadron of jet bombers would nonetheless increase the strength of our armed forces considerably."
GEN_Rocketery:0 "Rocketery"
GEN_Rocketery_desc:0 "Rocketry is a new and experimental technology, but one which many countries, especially the Germans, have begun the master. While still young, the field of rocketry has enormous potential, both on the smaller scale for creating tactical missiles and for larger strategic uses. We should certainly look into this field."
GEN_Paratrooper_Divisions:0 "Paratrooper Divisions"
GEN_Paratrooper_Divisions_desc:0 "Airborne operations are very risky, but have the potential to be decisive. Dropping ground forces behind enemy lines to disrupt reinforcements and supply can turn the tide of battle for an attacking force. It is definitely worth looking into this technology for our own forces."
#NAVY#
GEN_Naval_Age:0 "Naval Age"
GEN_Naval_Age_desc:0 "Though the era of pitched battles between battleships at sea is over, recent events, in particular the Pacific War, have shown we are entering a new naval age, where naval power is still a decisive weapon in warfare. As a result, we must invest in our naval forces."
GEN_Dockyard_Expansion_I:0 "Dockyard Expansion I"
GEN_Dockyard_Expansion_I_desc:0 "As we build up and modernise our naval forces, we need more industrial capacity to achieve this. More dockyards must be built, and existing ones expanded, to accommodate the increase in maritime construction that we are aiming for."
GEN_Dockyard_Expansion_II:0 "Dockyard Expansion II"
GEN_Dockyard_Expansion_II_desc:0 "While our naval expansion is progressing, it is not progressing fast enough. We must further increase our naval infrastructure to increase the rate that new vessels can be built and upgraded"
GEN_Modern_Marines:0 "Modern Marines"
GEN_Modern_Marines_desc:0 "History has shown that amphibious landings are certainly not easy, but can be decisive or even necessary in war. With new technological advances, such as in modern landing craft and amphibious vehicles, we should research new equipment and strategies for our marine forces."
GEN_Naval_Projection:0 "Naval Projection"
GEN_Naval_Projection_desc:0 "History has shown that it is not enough to have a navy - a nation must have overwhelming naval power to crush the fleets of its enemies and take control of the high seas. It may be an enormous investment, but it would do us no good to have an incapable fleet rather than a capable one."
GEN_Protect_The_Seas:0 "Protect The Seas"
GEN_Protect_The_Seas_desc:0 "If we are to utilise our naval power and compete in wars, we must be able to gain naval superiority over the high seas. Only then can we open up our supply lines and deny the sea lanes to our enemies, as the Americas achieved in their war against Japan."
GEN_Cruisers_Effort:0 "Cruiser Effort"
GEN_Cruisers_Effort_desc:0 "Both light and heavy cruisers will be a key part of our fleet. While not as unwieldy as the battleships of old, they nonetheless pack a great punch than smaller destroyers, and are a key component of naval power."
GEN_The_Seven_Seas:0 "The Seven Seas"
GEN_The_Seven_Seas_desc:0 "A true oceangoing navy should be our aim. We must make sure we have a fleet of sufficient size and with enough power projection to reach all corners of the world and respond anywhere on any body of open water. A true powerful fleet must have access to all of the seven seas."
GEN_Carrier_Effort:0 "Carrier Effort"
GEN_Carrier_Effort_desc:0 "In the modern age, the true hallmark of a powerful navy are no longer battleships, but carriers. These monstrous leviathans are able to bring air power to any part of the seas or coastal region, providing enormous power projection for the great powers that build them. Building our own carriers would be an enormous expense, but it will nonetheless allow us to join the ranks of true naval powers."
GEN_Naval_Aircrafts:0 "Naval Aircraft"
GEN_Naval_Aircrafts_desc:0 "A carrier, however large and powerful, is useless without good quality aircraft. We should focus on specialised naval fighters and bombers, able to be quickly and easily launched from carriers and equipped with munitions to attack enemy shipping."
GEN_Small_Fleet:0 "Small Fleet"
GEN_Small_Fleet_desc:0 "Having a large deep water navy would of course be ideal, but the reality is that our industrial output simply will never be sufficient to match the naval power of the great powers. Instead, we should focus on a relatively small but effective fleet that can punch above its weight, and defend our shores, instead of attempting to overstretch ourselves."
GEN_Destroyer_Fleet:0 "Destroyer Fleet"
GEN_Destroyer_Fleet_desc:0 "In all but the most powerful navies, destroyers form the core of naval power. Relatively small vessels, they are nonetheless useful and easy to produce. We should concentrate on destroyer development and production, to give our naval forces a good base of power."
GEN_Submarine_Warfare:0 "Submarine Warfare"
GEN_Submarine_Warfare_desc:0 "Though also having a relatively potent surface fleet, the Germans have also shown what heavy investment into submarines can achieve. Submarines are endlessly useful, able to sail undetected beneath the waves and attack shipping or enemy naval vessels without being seen. As we are likely to face more conventionally powerful naval powers, we should focus on submarines as a way to subvert their greater naval might."
GEN_Interception_Warfare:0 "Interception Warfare"
GEN_Interception_Warfare_desc:0 "The seas are the world's greatest avenue for transportation, and in times of war, control of the sea lanes will be crucial. As well as protecting our own assets, we should concentrate on developing methods of detecting and interdicting enemy shipping, using such technologies such as RADAR, in order to gain an advantage."
GEN_Lighting_Seas:0 "Lightning Seas"
GEN_Lighting_Seas_desc:0 "While our relatively small industrial power means that we cannot build ships that can compete in raw size and armament, what we can compete in is speed. Smaller, lighter, but still powerful ships can be much more nimble and versatile than larger ones, and can use their speed to their advantage by avoiding unfavourable attacks and battles."
GEN_Sea_Lances:0 "Sea Lances"
GEN_Sea_Lances_desc:0 "Big guns on battleships are a thing of the past, and carriers with their own air crews are too expensive for us, but one thing we can do is equip our smaller ships with modern weapons. By using naval missiles and other such recent developments, even small and light vessels can be turned into potent weapons."
#INDUSTRY#
GEN_Industrial_Efforts:0 "Industrial Efforts"
GEN_Industrial_Efforts_desc:0 "In the modern world, a nation without an industry cannot call its economy strong.

GEN_Consumer_Goods:0 "Consumer Goods"
GEN_Consumer_Goods_desc:0 "A key part of the civilian sector, consumer goods provide products, tools and other essentials to the population. Without them, we cannot possibly produce anything else in the first place, making them one of our main concerns."
GEN_Consumer_Goods_II:0 "Consumer Goods II"
GEN_Consumer_Goods_II_desc:0 "We have made considerable progress in our civilian industry and the concern for our wellbeing as of now, but there is a lot more to do. We should focus our economic development in the civilian sector and focus on it with utmost attention and hard work."
GEN_Civilian_First:0 "Civilian Industry First"
GEN_Civilian_First_desc:0 "Thanks to our investment and focus into the civilian industry, now the sector is prospering like never before, with production and number of factories significantly increasing. This can only strengthen our total industry and we expect even more progress from now on."

GEN_Global_Market:0 "Global Market"
GEN_Global_Market_desc:0 "We have opened our nation and economy to international trade and we are collecting the fruits of our success, but we must go further. Particularly, we shall open our market to the whole wide world. It can do nothing but benefit our society. After all, the saying goes "The freer the market, the freer the people""
#POLITICS+DIPOLMACY#
GEN_Politics_And_Diplomacy:0 "Politics and Diplomacy"
GEN_Politics_And_Diplomacy_desc:0 "We must now divert our attention onto the politics and diplomacy of our nation- Two key ingredients in the forging of a strong nation.
