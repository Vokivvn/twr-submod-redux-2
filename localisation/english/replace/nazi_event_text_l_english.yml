'The world has become tangled and complex. This country has always stood on it principles and been ready to defend them. We are no longer safe on our own. Neutrality is no longer the safe haven it used to be and those who seek power in this world do not respect it. We must stand with our fascist partners against the powers that seek to hold our nation back. Against a world who wants nothing more than keep us down. If we do not take a stand, we will perish alone.'"
