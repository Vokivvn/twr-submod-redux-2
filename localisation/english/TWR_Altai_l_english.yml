#### Description ####

Salchak_Toka_desc:0 "Salchak Toka, born on December 15th 1901, would be the man most responsible for the existence of Tuva as a state. Born in a rural town, Toka found himself working for Russians, and developing an affinity for Russian ideology. This only continued after the Russian Revolution began, which later sparked the independence of Tuva from China, with Socialist Russian support. However, it would be another decade before Tuva would fully embrace socialism, and cast off the remnants of Feudalism. Toka took this opportunity to become a leading member of the New Tuvan government, and shortly later came to lead it himself. However, his pro-soviet policies continued, which culminated in Tuva joining the USSR in 1943, upon Stalin's personal request.\n\nToka came to regret this decision, more than any other in his life. He could not have forseen the rise of Beria and Suslov, whom corrupted Socialist ideology, while oppressing the very minorities they claimed to defend. However, Tuva soon found itself under the Novosibirsk government, which embraced the Stalinism Toka himself so desired. But it was not to last, as this government shattered, and Zhukov came to control the area containing Tuva and the Altai. After a brief period of collaboration, with the Toka and Tuvans on the Plurinational Committee, this status quo collapsed. Zhukov's desire to reform socialism along his personal lines alienated the Tuvans, who once again began a war for independence. This war succeeded, with Toka at the head of Tuva's underground army, leading to the deaths of Zhukov and many of his greatest supporters. Toka now stands head of a once again independent Tuva, one he will fiercely defend, from Zhukovist fanatics and Liberal Capitalists alike."

Long live the free Tuvan state!"

The Tuvan nation will never fall again!"
