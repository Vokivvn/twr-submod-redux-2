southafrica.1.t:0 "South Africa in 1952"
southafrica.1.d:0 "The Union of South Africa is facing a crossroads. A dominion within the British Commonwealth, South Africa welds more influence than many have expected. The mostly Pro-British United Party has held power by a thread under the leadership of Jan Smuts and now Jan Hofmeyr. With the disaster of the Anglo-German War, and the close results of the subsequent 1943 and 48 elections, it's clear the general mood is changing in the south. \nParticularly amongst the Afrikaner population, there is a growing resentment against the British. Many Afrikaner leaders see South Africa's dominion status as a mere relic of the imperialist days of the past. Prime Minister Hofmeyr, an Afrikaner himself, continues however to stress the need of both parties to come together against the forces of division, channeling his famed namesake uncle. Whether his words shall be heeded remains to be seen. \nHowever, with the rise of Germany, many Afrikaner forces are seeing a new ally in their struggle against the British. Others however stress the need to go alone in the fight. The wounds from 1836 still live on. \nAs times change, another force rises. The African natives, hardly a new force, have proved to be a thorn in the side of both the Anglo-Africans and the Boer. In a country with a history of racial tension, could this union last any longer? \nIn a new unpredictable era of politics, the steps South Africa takes as a nation can prove to be crucial to Africa and the world."

southafricaflavour.1.t:0 "Van Riebeeck Festival"
southafricaflavour.1.d:0 "On the 6th April 1652, Jan van Riebeeck arrived at Table Bay, founding Cape Town for the Dutch and becoming the first commander of the colony. 300 years on, we are holding a festival to commemorate the events with pride. \n\nThe festival was officially opened by Prime Minister Hofmeyr, who proceded to give a speech on the founding, and the need to look to the future as well as reflecting on the past. The festival was also attended by National Party leader D. F. Malan, who gave his own words on the date significant in Afrikaner history. \n\nAs we celebrate, we do indeed look to the future. With one of the most crucial elections in our history coming soon, who knows what path we shall take by the time the next anniversary is here?"
southafricaflavour.1.a:0 "God bless South Africa!"
southafrica.2.t:0 "South Africa in 1952"
southafrica.2.d:0 "Dr. Hans van Rensburg, leader of the Ossewabrandwag organisation, has given a speech in Pretoria on the upcoming election campaign. Flanked by his Stormjaer bodyguards, Dr. van Rensburg spoke of his intention to boycott the elections, stating that both the National and United parties can no longer represent the needs of the Afrikaner within South Africa. He stated that the new prime minister, no matter his allegiance, will always be a puppet to the Anglo-Western world order. "An international clique has decided the fate of the Afrikaner volk, and therefore true change can never come through the ballot box." \n\nThe organisation was founded during the centenary of the Great Trek, using symbolism to represent the event, it has since became a prominent voice for extreme Afrikaner nationalists. \nHowever, the Ossewabrandwag has faced much criticism for their pro-German stance, with allegations of anti-Semitism and Nazism, Dr. van Rensburg having also visited the German Reich multiple times. Despite this, the organisation has received an increase in support in recent years, particularly from defectors from Malan's National Party. For now, it looks like Dr. van Rensburg is making a stand and is here to stay."
southafrica.2.a:0 "A Nazi agitator!"
southafrica.3.t:0 "The New National Party"
southafrica.3.d:0 "The National Party is a new force on the South African political stage. Led by Daniel F. Malan, the party has emerged out of the electoral alliance with the smaller Afrikaner Party and Malan's former Reunitied National Party. Now they're ready to take power and put an end to Hofmeyr's 'degrading of Afrikaner society'. The National Party campaign has very much been focused on the question of racial integration, emphasising the need to 'preserve Afrikaner heritage'.However, for many Afrikaners, this isn't enough. Many Afrikaner nationalists are rejecting Malan and the Nationals and are instead turning to the boycott campaign of the radical pro-German Ossewabrandwag. Many are in the belief that the National Party cannot and will not deliever true change to South Africa to benefit the cause of the Afrikaner. Others are concerned that with Malan's age, he may not occupy the office of PM for long in the event of a victory. Malan would be the oldest person to be appointed PM at age 79. Despite this, the National Party have been seeing a surge in support since the narrow results of 1948, will they be able to finally pull off a victory?"
southafrica.3.a:0 "We have to wait and see."
southafrica.4.t:0 "United Party Campaign"
southafrica.4.d:0 "The United Party campaign is facing a question. Led by the Liberal Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr, they hope to be reelected yet again. However, the Prime Minister is facing some serious questions in regard to his health.Not too much is known, though the prime minister has faced some health concerns in recent years and has indicated he'll be retiring not long after the election. With this in mind, the prime minister must make a decision on how much he'll be dedicating himself to the election campaign.In his current condition, doctor's advice is that he must take time off in order to improve his health, yet the prime minister would miss most of the campaign in doing so. Many close to the prime minister fear this could very well cost him the election, though many may prefer a healthy leader.While the United Party want to avoid having a campaign focused on the PM's health, it may be inevitable regardless. Many are sceptical of the official line on the prime minister's health. Opponents have naturally called for Hofmeyr to stand down as leader. With the election drawing near, the choice has to be made."
southafrica.4.a:0 "The Prime Minister will campaign whenever and wherever he can!"
southafrica.4.b:0 "A healthy Prime Minister is needed, he should limit his campaigning."

southafrica.6.t:0 "The 1953 South African Elections"
southafrica.6.d:0 "Election day has arrived, and with the way things are looking, this election may come to represent a turning point in the nation's history for generations to come. Opinion seems to be closer than ever.The campaign certainly hasn't been conventional. Will the United Party be able to win reelection yet again on their platform of reform for the 1950s? Will the National Party be able to pull off a victory instead with their platform of racial 'separateness'? The results of this election will not only define South Africa's future, but potentially that of the Commonwealth. The votes have been cast, the results are in, and the winner is..."
southafrica.6.a:0 "The United Party is re-elected!"
southafrica.6.b:0 "The National Party has won!"

SAF_apartheid:0 "Apartheid"
SAF_apartheid_desc:0 "Apartheid is the South African system of institutionalised racial segregation. The Apartheid policy is especially clear when it comes to Africans and White European citizens, where Whites tend to have more privilege and higher social standings in terms of politics. But with a new wave of self determination and doubts in the European system sweeping through the world, it will be harder for the government to enforce this system."
SAF_unrest:0 "South African Unrest"
SAF_unrest_desc:0 "The oppressed people of South Africa are starting to rise up against the minority ruling class. This wave of national defiance is creating severe instability for South Africa as a whole. Moreover, a divide in the politician class is blooming, with one side pushing for a South Africa closer to Toronto Accord, and one side attempting to distance themselves from the Commonwealth and in some cases, aligning themselves with the European far-right powers such as Italy and Germany. Overall, socially and politically, South Africa is heading towards ever greater instability."
