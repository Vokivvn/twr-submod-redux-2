bhutan.1.t:0 "The Death of Druk Gyalpo Wangchuck"
bhutan.1.d:0 "The nation is in mourning today as news emerges that the Dragon Emperor, or Druk Gyalpo, Jigme Wangchuck has passed away suddenly of natural causes at the age of 47. His son Jigme Dorji is already set to be crowned as the new Druk Gyalpo later this year, but the young and progress-driven Emperor will have to do much to convince Bhutan's conservative population that his proposed reforms will be of benefit to the nation. The Emperor will be cremated in Kurjey Monastery soon as his father was before him, and the funeral is expected to attract masses from all over the nation paying their respects."
bhutan.1.a:0 "May he find enlightenment in his next life."
