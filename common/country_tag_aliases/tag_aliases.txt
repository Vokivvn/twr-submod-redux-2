# tag aliases are country tags that maps to different countries depending on a set of triggers

#TAG = { #name of alias tag. must be 3 letters and different from any other tags. once this is defined, it will be available in any script that uses country tags

#	# if an alias is not mapped directly to a variable/event target, it will be searched within a list of countries that can be definied below
#	# you can use any combination of these below
#	# while checking for triggers/variables, current scope will be the country we are checking and PREV will be the scope that uses the alias
